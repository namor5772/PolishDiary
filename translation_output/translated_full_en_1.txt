I and war.
Maybe it is a funny title: “I and the War,” but when setting about writing these memories, I wanted to present my personal feelings and the story of my immediate family during the war and after it ended. The composition of my immediate family: I was 32 in ’39. Tulu (my husband) 36. My husband’s mother (Grandma) 70, the eldest daughter Lila 6, son Otuś 2, Ania was born 11-X-1939. There was also a girl—domestic help—Hela. We were then living in Krzemieniec on Objazdowa Street. Tulu was a teacher at the T. Czacki Lyceum in Krzemieniec and head of the natural science department in the “Museum of the Land of Krzemieniec.” I was not teaching then.
In May 1939 the children fell ill with scarlet fever—actually it supposedly has nothing to do with the war, and yet. The children were seriously ill, especially Oluś, and then I made a resolution that if the children recovered, I would give to the church what I had most precious—our wedding rings. War broke out—the government announced an appeal to replenish the national treasury, so we gave those rings as a gift. We often talked about how surely someone took them and fled (thousands of people fled) across the border, but deep down I did not regret and do not regret that step. My children and Poland are one. I remember how we did not leave the loudspeaker when the Germans were occupying Czechoslovakia, when the announcer said goodbye to the listeners, when for the last time the Czechoslovak anthem was played. I cried then and began to realize the horror approaching also us, Poland.
On 1-IX 39 mobilization was announced. I will not list exact dates here, only the facts, experiences that were fixed in my memory like images on a durable and precise plate. In the first days of September (or perhaps at the end of August) Tadzik’s mother (now my son-in-law) stopped by us on her way from Teremne for some treatment and asked for advice on what to do, whether to go or return home. I advised her to return home and that is what she did.
Tulu received double pay for two months, with which I bought some food such as flour, sugar, fat, coco[a] (with that cocoa I long diversified my Anusia’s food). I put these supplies in Grandma’s capacious chest, added to that a rather considerable amount of preserves and juices I had made in the summer, and we waited for the war—the war in Krzemieniec, the war in our home. Events unfolded like an avalanche. People passed through our house and our yard like in a kaleidoscope.
In the yard, full of cars. Refugees from western and central Poland were fleeing in crowds through Krzemieniec and Zeleszczyki to Romania. At night the road leading through the Dubno Gate (Dubieńska Rogatka) (a suburb of Krzemieniec) looked like a shining snake—that was the light of the vehicles, an unbroken stream. The hum of the vehicles reached the apartment. On one fine day (probably around 11 September 1939) no one expected a bombing. The refugees dispersed to make purchases of food and there was plenty of it at the market then (the peasants had already heard about the approaching Soviet troops and supposed that their farms would be collectivized, and therefore they were selling off their property). With the wave of refugees a girl about 12 years old got to Krzemieniec. She was completely without family—we took her in—her name was Janka. On that beautiful morning, after a consultation with Grandma, we sent Janka to the market for plums for dumplings. Tulu went to report or hand in the radio to the police. And then the bombing began. German airplanes descended right over the market packed with people and directly strafed the populace with machine guns. At the same time the entire main street was bombed; even the cemetery suffered severely. Many people died then. The girl—Janka—jumped into the nearest entryway, in which out of fear she sat almost until evening. Tulu, in the abandoned police building, lay down under a window and returned safe and sound. I was pregnant with Ania (Ania was born 11-X 39), I snatched two-year-old Otuś into my arms, Lila by the hand, and calling to Grandma I ran and took shelter in the so-called “Skałki Dziewicze.” There were many people there from nearby houses. Grandma began to turn around in circles, ran into the apartment and stayed at home. When we then found ourselves all at home—I with the children and Tulu—we began to worry about Janka. Tulu went to the market and somehow found her and brought her home. From that day on there was alarm after alarm. We sheltered in the cellar, but in the end we no longer reacted to the sirens and sat normally at home; only little Lila sat in the cellar all day long and, green with fear, dragged us all down there. At last the alarms ceased; among the people the news spread that Soviet troops were approaching. The end of Poland and, as the Ukrainians said, “Poland has burst.” A new partition of Poland ensued—They divided Her, the Russians and the Germans. I cried terribly, but I bustled about the house, cleaning, scrubbing and crying. One of the refugees, Marek—a miner—began to comfort me that he was in a worse situation because he was cut off from his family and the Germans were already there, that after all the world would not leave us like that. We learned already that England had also declared war. We had been waiting already from 1-IX 39 for the end of the war, the end of the war day by day. From the first days of September, prophecies and suppositions began to circulate that in a month, in 60 days, in 3 months it would be the end, that somewhere the Polish nation and the army were resisting the Germans, etc., etc. I forgot to write that during the last prewar vacation Kazik Unold stayed with us—Hela, my sister—the mother of Kazik—was at a teacher’s course in Zaolzie. She dropped in to us at the beginning of September and took Kazik and went, in accordance with orders of the Polish government, to Podlis near Kowel to teach. It was a terrible Ukrainian village. Some of its inhabitants were already in September robbing and killing refugees and Polish soldiers. Luckily nothing happened to Hela—there was a trial held over her composed of the entire population of the village—they had nothing against Her, and the politruk of the Soviet army, who was of Polish origin, presided over that tribunal. Hela even became the director of a ten-year school. I had heard a lot about the Bolshevik army and wanted to see it. The Ukrainians set up triumphal arches for them, greeted them with bread and salt. They marched down the broad (main street of Krzemieniec). The soldiers, short, slender, impoverished, walked in helmets that covered half their faces. The Ukrainian neighbor women, instead of looking at them, looked at me, and I was choked with tears.
Life in Krzemieniec slowly began to normalize. Some Polish refugees returned to their places in the General Government, some—especially men—fled abroad, mostly to Romania, some were deported to Siberia, and fragments of the Polish Army fell into Russian captivity. Some were immediately massacred by the Ukrainians.
One of those who tried to get across the border was Witold Duda—Lolek. He visited us in Krzemieniec around 15 X-39, said goodbye (in “Poland’s time” he was the head of the post office in Stalowa Wola and a reserve lieutenant) and set off toward Zdeszczyk. At the border he was caught by the Soviets and deported to a penal camp in the Komi Republic. Since I am already writing about Him, I will finish His story. Only after a year did he write to you from the camp a laconic card that he was healthy. That was all the news about Him during the war. Only after the war did we get in touch with Him and learn how he survived. After we received the card, we prepared a parcel (rusks made with eggs and milk, garlic, linden blossom, and a bit of bacon) and with great difficulty sent it—I went with it as far as Smygi near Krzemieniec—the Bolsheviks made sending parcels difficult (The weight of the shipment could not exceed 2 kg). Every time they designated different points and at different times. That parcel supposedly saved his life, for he was already dying of hunger. When it came to an agreement between Stalin and Sikorski—Lotek joined Anders’s Army. Along the way he married Danka Musiałówna, who had also been deported to Siberia. Lotek fought in Italy near Ancona. He left the army after the war with the rank of captain. He was in England and then went to Argentina, to Barilosze. He has a son, Andrzej, who has already married, and an adopted little daughter. Now he would gladly return to Poland.
But back to us. My delivery was approaching. The yard emptied of refugees. The girl we had taken in left for her parents. On 9-X snow fell unexpectedly. Afraid that the vegetables in the garden would freeze—I dug them out from under the snow and carried them wet and heavy to the cellar, and that may have hastened the birth. Around 12 at night I sent Tulu for the midwife. Grandma was feeling poorly, so I lit the fire in the stove myself, put water on, prepared the [swaddling blanket] and little shirts. Before the midwife washed her hands—Anusia came into the world. A brave, clever little girl. Brave to the point of risk. She has already been on two “women’s cruises” (there were four women of them), at present, as I write this, she is sailing only with Krysia on a small club yacht across the Baltic to the Gulf of Finland. I have always worried about Her, and now enormously, because on the previous cruise they almost paid with their lives. At first Grandma was saddened that it was not a little boy, but after a few days Anusia pleased Her greatly. I lay only 3 days, and that off and on, because I had to bathe and diaper the child myself—the midwife did not come and Grandma was afraid.
After Anusia’s birth the weather turned beautiful. It was then that Tulu’s brother Lotek burst in on us. Tulu taught in two Ukrainian schools. Polish schools were abolished. I was a “housewife.” To maintain—or rather feed—the family was no small art. One had to stand in line for everything, and the lines were enormous, because to Krzemieniec very many Jews had fled from the General Government. I sometimes took my place at midnight to bring 25 dkg of sugar or at most 1/2 kg, and often I came back empty-handed. Sometimes I managed to get a little candy (very poor), and then there were feasts because the grown-ups could also have tea “na prekusku.” The sugar was only for the children. There were lines for bread. I usually brought home wholemeal bread—we like wholemeal, but for the children, and especially little Ania, it did not taste good. Lines for flour, lines for salt. Polish textile materials disappeared like camphor; some people bought them up already in September, and the rest the Bolshevik authorities confiscated and hauled away. From time to time shipments came through from Russia, but they were unbelievably poor materials. Mostly printed, shabby percales. I once bought (I stood in an enormous line) a few meters—the children had pajamas sewn by Grandma, and I sewed myself a dress. The pajamas shed in the first washing, and my dress after the first line looked like a rag. In that line they also tore my dress. I borrowed one safety pin and came home like that. There was no laundry soap. I made lye from ash and soaped the dirtier parts of the underwear lightly with toilet soap because that one could be bought from time to time. Bed linen was worn on both sides. Tulu mostly had light, typical shirts with sleeves, and that washing was a torment—of course by the traditional method in the washtub and with a washboard. For milk the peasants did not want to accept money, so I gave from the house coats, shoes, curtains, because milk had to be for the children. Fuel disappeared, and from almost the very beginning of the war until the moment of our escape from Krzemieniec we burned what I dragged from the forest or stole from nearby fences. In the forest I looked for the longest possible branches, tied the thicker end, put it over my shoulder and dragged it home. My left shoulder was swollen and sore. In the vicinity of Krzemieniec there was peat, but they sold it only to Ukrainians or to those who worked with it. I too went to Sapanów. I worked literally on bread and water. I slept at a peasant’s on hay, and even then it was already dangerous because the peasants were preparing to murder Poles. I arranged peat in small stacks on a measured area. In the evening I could not straighten my lower back, and blood came from the tips of my fingers. In spite of everything I lasted a dozen or so days and brought home large carts of peat. That was a treasure, because winter was approaching and I no longer had the strength to go to the forest. I brought that peat just before the war between the USSR and Germany, and under the German occupation a Pole simply had no right to go into the forest, because from both the Germans and the Ukrainians death threatened. It was lucky that Grandma was at home, who looked after the children, because I was constantly “on the move,” either in lines, or exchanging clothing for food, or to the forest for wood.
Until the war with Germany we were terribly afraid of deportation to Siberia. At first they deported families of military men, policemen, the forest service, high officials, families of suspects, and we belonged to them too, because Tulu’s brother—Witold—was in a penal camp in Siberia. All Poles were “suspect,” even refugees from the General Government. For fear of deportation I constantly kept bread rusks, dry pasta, and I nursed Ania to a year and a half. Since Tulu was working, it was hard with the baptism, and besides we were waiting for the end of the war and then the christening would be ceremonial in the circle of the family. Meanwhile the end of the war did not come and Ania was growing, so as a one-and-a-half-year-old little girl she went on foot with Grandma and me to the church. Our acquaintance Mr. Werner and Balcia “held” her at the baptism. I write in quotation marks “held” because I remember that Ania, in a long cream dress reworked from my prewar evening gown, stood by herself on a chest in the sacristy. Ania was already then running well and talking. Despite the hard times Ania was thriving. She began to walk in the ninth month. Grandma was very happy that she became a godmother; after the other grandma (my mother) she received a name that I like very much—Joanna. I, as I have already mentioned, was constantly busy and in a flurry; in return Grandma told the children lovely fairy tales of her own invention, read to them, fed them. I also read to them a bit, especially Porazińska’s little poems. I remember that I made up melodies for almost all the little poems and read them “singingly,” and later, when I taught, I also “sang” in the first grades. Little Lila had just before the war passed her first entrance exam to grade 1 of the practice school attached to the Lyceum. Naturally she passed it well, especially as regards colors. In September 1939 Lila began to go to the first grade, but since “Poland has fallen” the language of instruction was Ukrainian and Lila did not know it at all—and besides, after all, we expected the end of the war any day, so we took Lila out. I remember that classes were held even on Sunday, and that too put me off, and Lila stayed at home. I taught her off and on to read and write—she learned quickly; with arithmetic it went harder, but only now do I realize that Lila was a clever little girl, because she learned the four operations within 20 and then 100 without manipulatives and without greater explanations. Little Otuś listened to fairy tales and rode a lot with Daddy on the bicycle. Otuś was born already with black hair—I was a brunette too—and when I went with Otuś, everyone took us for Jews. The children had only a few toys. Just before the war Oluś got a little monkey, and with that little monkey we fled from Krzemieniec; that little monkey was still knocking about on Helena in Sącz. I regret that I did not keep it. Instead of toys the children had lots of little books, paints, paper, crayons. Otuś early began to draw tiny little people—the whole pages swarmed with [drawing of stick figure] and I sang to them
I am an old man, old man
What will I eat, eat
I will go to the little market
I will buy a little loaf of bread
I will eat it, eat
" " " .
These were the nicest moments in those macabre times. One could not come to terms with the fact that everything "Topło," as the Ukrainians said. It seemed to me that I would hold it all together if it was clean at home. I do not know where my strength, energy came from. The first Easter holidays were approaching. I baked some cookies and bought, from a clandestine slaughter, a quarter of a pig. I made sausages. I polished the floors, washed the runners. These were the most wonderful holidays for the whole time of the war. There was even some spirit in the house, which Tulu received from a distribution from the Museum of the Land of Krzemieniec. For this spirit I received produce from the peasants. Tulu slept in a separate room, he had a stack of books beside him because he was preparing for lessons. I, with the children and Grandma, in the bedroom. At midnight I hear the sounds of sleigh bells (although it was the Easter holidays szpa snow - the holidays were in March). It was the time of deportations to Siberia. Someone is pounding on the door from the yard side. I open in a nightshirt and several Bolshevik soldiers barge into the apartment. One stood by the door with a rifle and the rest spread out through the apartment. Tulu berat. They did a search, looked through the books. Grandma was somewhat unwell and was shaking with fear, begging the soldiers for her son's life. Next .... they ordered that they be given vodka (I diluted our entire supply of spirit with juice), I served the leftovers of meat, salt pork, garlic and onions. They drank, ate, wrestled among themselves and in the process made a mess in the whole house and left at dawn. With difficulty I brought the apartment into order.
The matter of the relatives - the Majkos.
At the beginning of the war, Gena Majkowa—Tula’s cousin—wrote to us. She wrote that her husband Adam—the headmaster of the school in Małoryta near Chełm Lubelski—had died; she (his wife) was left without means of support with three children. After deliberating, we wrote her a letter to come to us, that somehow together we would push along in poverty. Despite the war I had the apartment clean, the floors buffed, clean bedding. We took her in like our own, into our beds, into the shared kitchen. After a short time I realized that lice had crawled onto us from them, and from then on almost the whole war it was lice and lice, and there was no soap, [soda], both under the Bolsheviks and the Germans. The second matter was shared food. Genia did not want to give up good food. She sulked when, for example, the milk soups were half and half with water, when I divided the meat over several dinners. The third matter was her eldest son Tadzik. This boy was about 14 at the beginning of the war and habitually stole. He robbed us, he robbed his mother, he “sponged off” acquaintances, invoking kinship with us. I suppose it was the parents’ fault. He was one of twins. His brother died, and over Tadzik the parents fussed and allowed him everything. At the moment when they came to us, Tadzik was about 14, Krysia about 3 years old, and Ceśiu about 2 years. At that time we occupied 3 rooms, a balcony, and a kitchen. I cannot stand that Tadek, I separated myself—ceding them one room and a place in the kitchen. Genia went to work at the brewery. We could, however, have lived together under one roof if not for Tadek. Even the Militia came to us because of Tadek. There was no way out—we had to move out. The owners of a vacant apartment demanded six months’ rent in advance. For that purpose we sold my gold watch, an “Omega,” Tula’s suit, we added from Tula’s pay and we moved. We were, as they say, completely “broke,” without money, without food, but in the house on Lipowa Street there was peace. Not for long, however, because the war between the Germans and the Z P P R came.
On Lipowa Street we lived on the upper floor. We also had 3 rooms, a balcony, a kitchenette. One little room was hung with beautiful display cases with insects. The display cases were made by a carpenter according to Tula’s design, at our expense. The collections were beautiful; they remained in the Krzemieniec museum. The work and value truly priceless. Since I met Tula, he constantly collected something; there was not a single excursion that took place without some purpose, and above all catching insects and collecting plants. At night we also went with white sheets and flashlights for moths. All our belongings remained in Krzemieniec: insects, collections of plants, books, paintings, furniture, dishes, bedding.
Germans
One day Tulu came back from a conference and says that something is "brewing" and that the inspector, a Russian, was calming the teachers and they advised them to go for a walk to Bona Hill (there were and still are there the ruins of Bona's castle. From this hill a beautiful view spreads over Krzemieniec and the immediate surroundings). The next day there was bustle in the town. There was nothing to eat at home. I took Ania in my arms and stood in the "line" for bread. I was standing on Szeroka Street when suddenly shooting began; two Germans on a motorcycle appeared on the street. Luckily Tulu left the house, found me, snatched Ania into his arms, and we jumped into the stream flowing right behind the houses. The streets emptied out instantly. Along the stream we went upstream, ran across Szeroka Street, jumped onto our little street and into the house, but without bread, which from then on we constantly lacked; from then on hunger visited our home. One enemy fled — the other seized us. The Soviets, just before the Germans entered, murdered all the prisoners. People returned from the prison in tears, and some recognized among the bestially murdered — their relatives, acquaintances.
Hunger under the German occupation
Tulu worked at the Museum, an institution that the Germans only seemingly tolerated but in essence tried to destroy. They would issue, for example, orders to vacate the existing museum premises within a single day. The staff frantically looked for the next place and carried the exhibits on their backs themselves. I remember that Tulu earned so little that with a whole month’s “salary” one could buy on the black market “one kg. of butter.” It was sacrificial work, but the museum survived and exists to this day together with Tulu’s insect display cases and the huge collections of plants.
Food rations were not enough even to support one person, and here we had to feed three children and three adults. I brought once a week ¾ of a barley bread loaf, which we ate immediately (the next day it turned bitter and crumbled like sawdust), a bit of disgusting marmalade, and from time to time a dozen or so dkg. of meat. Whatever was in the house I bartered for food. Coats, curtains, leather briefcases (people made shoes out of them), paintings. For Grandma’s black coat with a sealskin collar I got nearly one meter of wheat. It was a treasure. We ground that golden grain on quernstones concealed from the Germans. From the flour I made [a pour-over soup], dumplings, and to the bran I added grated red beets and baked pancakes on the stove. The mother of our landlords, who was staying in the countryside with the priest’s son, learned about this wheat. She asked us to lend her that wheat because she wanted to grind a larger quantity, and she would bring it right back from the countryside and return it to us. She took it and that was the last we saw of her. That was inhuman, because the Ukrainians were the Germans’ favorites and had food in abundance. I bartered, for example, beautiful curtains for 25 kg of millet groats. For a whole month, apart from that groats and 1 liter of milk a day, we ate nothing else. I received 30 liters of milk for two beautiful, hand-embroidered pictures of the Mother of God and the Lord Jesus. Tulu, coming back from work, would secretly get 2–3 sugar beets from which I baked, with the addition of bran, pancakes, or I boiled down “honey.” Another time I traded some garment for a little rye, which we ground with Tulu on the museum quernstones. For a while I kept two pupils, the priest’s children, as boarders. Payment was food: some potatoes, flour, and salt pork. It was paradise, but it didn’t last long, because the priest took the children away from the Poles. Mr. Niedźwiecki lived with us for a while; he had family in the village and thus had his own food, he paid us something for the lodging, but I pilfered “this and that” from him. I remember that once, famished, I ate a piece of cured meat but I got terribly sick—“stolen goods do not fatten.” This Mr. Niedźwiecki was a great patriot, he went to Warsaw, took part in the uprising and supposedly was killed. I write “went,” but those were escapes at the risk of life. Tulu brought from the Museum caustic soda, and we made soap. Soap was made not only from tallow, which was very hard to get, but also from eggs, from hens, from carrion with the addition of peas for better foaming. With this “merchandise” I went around the villages and bartered for whatever I could, and it was already dangerous—the Ukrainians were preparing to murder Poles. Dad got from the Museum a bucket of salt (I don’t know where that salt came from there). The director at that time was Ukrainian; he could have given us more but preferred to give to his own—some even got a meter of salt. There was also a shortage of salt under the German occupation. That salt also helped us a bit. I remember that one time I traded 1 glass of salt for a hen. Unfortunately the hen either fell ill with us, or the woman had already given us a sick one. I couldn’t reconcile myself to the loss of the hen. I doused it with water to revive it and poured sour milk into its beak, and I cured the hen. Previously a Ukrainian neighbor woman killed poultry for me; now she didn’t want to do that for a Polish woman. Tulu accomplished that deed. He took the hen and on a stump cut off its head, but he came out of the shed so pale that I never again turned to Him in such a matter. And we also had to share this food with a Jewish woman. The Germans, or rather the Ukrainian militia, drove Jews from the ghetto to work. On the way one Jewish woman would drop by to us with a request for food. I always gave her something, either a few potatoes or a handful of some groats. One time I literally had nothing in the house, and as proof I showed her the peels from the last potatoes. The peels were very thin (as we say in our area, you could see Krakow through them), I gave them at the Jewish woman’s request. In general, potatoes were a delicacy. I usually cooked them in their skins. One time I had only a few, too few to eat them by themselves. So I made pierogi from them, and since I had only rye flour, I kneaded dough from it, I “greased” the pierogi with onion browned on a bit of cream. The children were very satisfied, so much so that Lila wrote about it in her little diary (it got lost somewhere, and that’s a great pity). One time we got from a museum colleague some poor plums (that was Obolończyk—currently a doctor in Kyiv). I also kneaded dough from wholemeal flour and made “knedle,” I poured over them saccharin dissolved in water; Otuś called to his peer Dzidka Targońska from the balcony or from the window that at our place there were knedle for dinner. Tulu obtained some food by riding a bicycle to Chodak to Hela. He brought from Her cabbage, a bit of groats. The trips were dangerous because the Ukrainians were already really getting ready to go after Poles. Tulu took detours and went around villages. One time he took his winter coat to a peasant to trade. He got a goose and some honey for it—it was a feast for a few days. Sometimes one of the Unolds came to us—(Jan from Szumska or Apolinary from Chodak). Almost always they brought meat from clandestine slaughter to sell. I distributed it among acquaintances. It was a very dangerous affair for those times. For such things the Germans even punished with death. For ourselves I kept the scraps, for which I also paid them. Actually, we might not have suffered hunger because They (the Unolds) lived in the countryside and had it in abundance. But the sated do not believe the hungry, and They were killed. Our beverages were tea from scorched apple peels, from linden blossom or strawberry leaves. The one from strawberry leaves was probably the best. I also tried to make acorn coffee from scorched halves, but it was a Sisyphean task because I could never grind them nor even crush them in a mortar. I have gone on at such length about this hunger, but it was an enormous problem that essentially rested on me.
Death of Grandmother Duda
This is actually connected with that hunger. Grandma was vigorous, and if not for the war she would have lived much longer. She liked meat, fats, and here suddenly hunger, so she declined greatly in strength. One time Julek Unold (Aunt Hela’s husband) came to Krzemieniec with a consignment of tobacco. He dropped by us and talked me into going to Chodak (40 km) so that I could bring myself something in food. I pulled out the remnants of clothes for exchange and was already about to go when Grandma started a row with me that I was leaving them alone. I explain that after all I will bring home some bacon, flour, butter, but Grandma is still angry. I was already downstairs and was about to get on the cart, but “something touched me,” I turned back and said a heartfelt goodbye to Grandma. To this day I regret that I left then, because after all Grandma would have lived longer. In Chodaki I exchanged the clothes primarily for fat, and every day I went to the quern to grind wheat, because Julek told me that however much of it I ground, that much I could take for myself to Krzemieniec. We both, Hela and I, went (Hela was then pregnant with Alek) because they also ground for themselves on the quern-stones. I was terribly impatient, and there that neighbor, who was also supposed to go with a consignment of tobacco, delayed departure because the Germans did not allow leaving Chodaki. Only after about 10 days did I leave Chodaki, and on the way in Szumsk I received a telegram that Grandma had died. That was at the end of winter. The apartment was cold. You went to the kitchen through the hallway—the kitchen above the stairs. Grandma warmed herself by the stove in the room, and she would go out to the kitchen to cook something for the children, and she must have gotten pneumonia. Before Tulu realized and called a doctor it was already too late. If I had been there then maybe she wouldn’t have caught cold, or I would have immediately put cups on Grandma and she would have been saved. I cried terribly and I feel sorry for her to this day. I know that if she were alive, now she would be about 100 years old, but I am sorry that she does not watch television, does not listen to music, and she was very musical. She does not rejoice in the grandchildren—or maybe she does?! I beg my mother for care over my children, and maybe ask Her, Grandma Dudowa, for it too? Tulu and I put up a little monument on Her grave (three years ago, in 1970), and somehow I feel lighter. In her lifetime she used to go for a walk to the “Tunicki Cemetery,” sit on the grave of Słowacki’s mother and say to Lila that she would bring Her (Grandma) flowers because she wants to be buried here. And so it happened—Her grave is located right next to the grave of Salomea Słowacka. I remember that I sewed from my red sweater tights for Ania (from the sleeves) and for Otuś (from the back). The children (Ania and Oluś) did not realize what death was and chased each other around the catafalque. Balcia’s old accordion was left in a trunk in Krzemieniec.
Jews
We were living recently in such a little villa upstairs, and downstairs, right after the Germans entered, Jews moved in. It was a very wealthy childless family. They wanted to store some things with us. Tulu, however, absolutely did not want to agree. One time when we both left the house they begged Grandma and basically forced in a pile of suitcases and beautiful fluffy blankets. I returned from town and “laid into” Grandma with reproaches. Tulu came back and firmly told me to take that baggage back to the Jews. Tulu was convinced that keeping things, and all the more using, taking advantage of the belongings of Jews so cruelly persecuted would also bring misfortune upon us. Maybe he was right?! I returned them and I do not regret it. The Jews were taken to the ghetto—surely they perished. It is extremely cruel, it is a terrible disgrace for the Germans and the Ukrainians who with all their soul helped to liquidate and persecute the Jews. I remember how the ghetto was burning, how a shootout broke out because the Jews defended themselves. I walked around like a madwoman, my head hurt without interruption. And yet we had to live. I gathered a whole bag of old shoes in order to use them to repair three pairs of the most serviceable ones. As luck would have it, the cobbler lived opposite the gate to the ghetto. I saw a vehicle coming out of it. It was a truck loaded with Jews. They were crammed together, hunched, because on their backs lay a huge wooden “deka,” and on it sat several Ukrainian militiamen with rifles ready to fire. Tulu’s apprentice saw with his own eyes how over the mass graves—pits footbridges had been laid, on which the Jews, stripped naked, would stand, and whom the Gestapo men shot. They had their machine guns set on stands; when they got tired of killing they would light a cigarette, have a bite to eat, and back “to work.” The next day they drove a road roller over the graves covered with lime and earth.
One day, not long after the Germans entered, I went and stood in the queue for bread; because I was taken for a Jewish woman, the Ukrainians began to murmur, to look at me ominously. Fortunately, one neighbor (a Polish woman) was standing not far away who had lived in Krzemieniec since birth and therefore was better known than I, and she began to explain that I am a Catholic Pole and not a Jewish woman.
However, I did not get any bread, although I identified myself to the seller with a chain with the Mother of God, and I was a witness to a cruel scene. I overheard a racket and screams coming from the neighboring entryway and saw a Jew in a caftan with sidelocks jump out into the street. Several people ran out after him, and “people” from the queue joined them, who grabbed stones and literally stoned that Jew. The little street was unpaved, not asphalted. One time I saw an old Jewish woman carrying on “koromysłach” two wooden pails of water; the road went uphill, from which a sleigh came with the carter standing on it. The peasant deliberately ran over the Jewish woman, who got under that sleigh, and it dragged that screaming Jewish woman while the man swung his whip and did not stop. I was screaming too, out of horror.
Ukrainians
Poles in the General Government were persecuted by the Germans in a terrible way, but for us in the so-called Ukraine it was probably even worse. In the General Government it was the Germans against the Poles, and here yet another terrible enemy joined in: the Ukrainians, and we were a minority. The Ukrainians kept pace with the Germans. It was they who handed us over into the hands of the Bolsheviks and then the Germans. They are the ones who delivered such truly very valuable people to death (Prof. Opolski, Mączak, Sawojcówna, Torgoński, Szynajowiecz, and many, many others). This awaited us too, and above all Tula, but the eastern front began to approach, and so we fled. Prof. Mączak was the founder of the Museum, Dr. Opolski wrote, just before the war, a treatise on Hitlerism. One hears nothing about Ukrainians being in and dying in concentration camps.Ania had some severe pains; at times she cried. No wonder, if at home there was, for example, only rye flour (Maybe that’s why I don’t like rye bread so much). So I took Ania in my arms and went to the “Gebitskomisarza” for semolina for Ania. I waited about two hours to be admitted into the presence of the dignitary. I explained my request to the Ukrainian interpreter, and they jabbered among themselves and did not give me even 25 dkg of semolina. First the Ukrainians betrayed us and informed to the Bolsheviks—never would so many of us have been deported to Siberia, taken to prisons, shot if not for the Ukrainians. As soon as the war began the Ukrainians contacted the Germans through transmitter stations, murdered refugees from Western Poland, and so on and so forth.
The death of Julek Unold, his brothers, the death of thousands of Poles at the hands of the Ukrainians.
Denunciations against Poles, arrests by the Germans and their murder—that went on all the time. Then the Ukrainians themselves began to murder individual Poles, then whole villages, settlements. At Easter came news from Chodak that Julek Unold had been murdered, that this and that acquaintance had been killed in the county, and then a whole avalanche of murdered Poles, whole families with children, old people, whole villages. The Poles defended themselves, fled to larger concentrations—they organized themselves (Read “Red Nights” by Cybulski). Many Poles from the surrounding villages found themselves in Krzemieniec, whole phalanxes of refugees, already under the cover of German rifles, were making their way to Krzemieniec. For some time I went out every day to the “Wiśniowiecka Tollgate” and waited, in tears, for Hela with the children. I saw those poor people, some on carts, others on foot with bundles and children. They slept on boards in the lyceum church, spread out among Polish homes; from the German side there also awaited them the danger of deportation to work in Germany. The Poles—the inhabitants of Krzemieniec—organized for them and helped as they could. I, with Mrs. Doroszukiewa, also cooked a bucket of soup several times. We chipped in together for it. It was mostly potatoes with dumplings. The soup was with fat. I went around to the Ukrainian neighbors and directly demanded fat. Some gave, for example the Skibinieckis; others, for example the spiteful Ukrainian woman Turkowa, did not want to give even a slice. When, indignant, shaken, I spoke about this, she told me: “well, it’s hard, where they chop wood, chips fly.” The “Phalanxes”—whole wagon-trains of Poles were leaving their settlements, until finally in one wagon-train there was Mrs. Unold [Maria] with two children—the wife of Jan Unold, cruelly murdered in Szumsk. She moved in with us. Right after our escape from Krzemieniec she too managed to escape. She lived in Opole. The children got an education, got married. She has already died of cancer. Hela, on the other hand, fled with the children to Ostróg—from there to Bożęcin near Tarnów, where at that time two of our brothers Kazek and Staszek lived. Of the four Unold brothers, only one, Apolinary, was miraculously saved, and three died. One of them, Florian—the head of a school near Kowel—was killed together with his wife Dalka precisely at Easter. The nine-year-old eldest son (Zbyszek) and his two younger brothers (one was an infant) survived. The godparents of one of them from Kowel took care of them, but when later they fled from Kowel, the youngest little boy was shot and also died. The eldest—Zbyszek—buried his mother and father himself, and had only a Ukrainian teenage friend to help him. The village head was afraid to take care of the burial because it was forbidden to bury “Lachs.” He was afraid to give those children a cart so they could drive to Kowel. The son of our landlady was a militiaman. We had a bicycle and he borrowed it almost every day. Tulu from the museum would come and yell at me about why I had lent out the bicycle. I went to them as if to an execution and asked for it back (they lived in the courtyard in the annex). They gave it back to me with a sullen look. It was like that a dozen or so times, but we saved the bicycle and sold it right before our escape from Krzemieniec.
One day, in the courtyard people began to mill about who were speaking among themselves in Ukrainian. I asked them what they were doing here, and they said that they had fled from Rybcza (a village near Krzemieniec) from the Ukrainians. Astonished, I said that after all they were murdering Poles and not Ukrainians—then I got the reply that they were Poles, but did not know Polish. The Ukrainians do not ask whether one is from this land from grandfather and great-grandfather, they just murder; they also murder mixed marriages.
Our children during the war
Lilusia, who in ’39 was 6 years old, suffered through these times the most. She hid in the cellar the most during alarms; she with all her strength wanted there to be a home, and yet everything was falling apart. She had enlarged hilar glands and I was terribly worried about her. In our home three siblings died of tuberculosis; Tulu’s brother died of tuberculosis. As soon as I left the house I cried, and there the child was starving. The husband of our neighbor, Mr. Kruczkowski, was the manager of a state estate, that is, a German one. They were then living in the countryside in a manor (in Buchłów), they had everything in abundance. They proposed taking Lila to their place for some time. She had attentive care, wonderful victuals: dairy, meat, fruit, but what of it, Lila looked for secluded places in the park and cried. The doctor who was visiting them said that she was crying for home. Tulu went by bicycle and had to take her home. She insisted that for one Easter holiday (it was our last holiday there) the house be whitewashed. I had a broken arm in a cast then, luckily the left one, so with my right hand I whitewashed and washed. Her First Holy Communion took place in the lyceum church. She attended preparations very briefly. She had a borrowed little dress, sandals, wooden clogs—Tulu made them. The upper part was from my white felt hat. I prepared the wreath, the candle, and let her beautiful hair down, and at that time she had long braids. When the neighbor Polish women found out that Lila was going to First Holy Communion, they brought her a veil at the last moment and pinned it on her head themselves. Grandma did not live to see that moment anymore, and Lila went to church alone, for I had no one to leave the children with, and I was ashamed to go with the children because I had nothing to dress them in. I did not have much time to take care of her education, and Tulu did not know how. When she had almost taught herself to read and write, Tulu gave her his student “textbooks” and made her read aloud. Naturally she herself told me later that she did not understand anything from them. Altogether, throughout the duration of the war, as I calculated, Lila attended school all of 15 months. A few months in Zmigrod, a few weeks in Turza, and a few months in Zawada. In N. Sącz she immediately went to S of the lyceum. In some subjects she was oriented even very well—in others she had no idea at all. In his free moments Tulu painted, he also gave Lila paints, cardboard, and I remember her first picture: it was a fir twig in a little vase.Where are you now, my Lilusia ?!
Otuś was 2 years old at the outbreak of the war. He, like Lila, had had scarlet fever. Lila had enlarged hilar glands, and Otuś murmurs in his little heart. The child was growing; there was nothing to dress him in. I did not know how to sew, and that was simply a misfortune, especially in wartime; besides, I did not have a machine. Since childhood I had always liked to embroider. In wartime I could not afford a seamstress; a hairdresser was out of the question too, so I trimmed Otuś’s hair myself “a la pot.” Some shirts and blouses I cobbled together by hand myself, but it looked “God have mercy.” Oluś was often sick. In Krzemieniec he got pneumonia, and here there was neither doctor nor medicines. We had acquaintances who worked in a German military hospital, and from them we got some pills, only I do not remember which—I set up cupping glasses and it somehow helped him as well as Lila. Education consisted above all of stacks of prewar “Płomyczek”s and Grandma’s stories, and from time to time my reading of children’s books. I liked to sing to the children, and I am amazed at myself how I could do that in such macabre times. Part of the children’s education also included Tulu’s bicycle outings with Otuś and Lila in turn. They rode through the forests, they rode to the [Ikwa] until the Ukrainians began to murder, for then one could no longer even “poke one’s nose” out of the town. I taught Otuś to read and write in his sixth year of life during regular lessons with Bogna, Nusia’s daughter. That was already after our flight from Krzemieniec. From his earliest years Otuś made little maps and liked to look at geographic atlases. I remember how, after the setting of the arm, I was returning from the hospital after one night spent there. I was returning anxious and at the same time happy to the children, and I saw from afar Ania and Otuś standing on the little porch. When I began to call to them, then the children disappeared into my little barrel, which stood on the small balcony. They (the children) thought that I had been entirely deprived of one arm and therefore hid. Anusia, as they say, was born under the drums. As long as she was an infant there was no trouble, for she had a stroller, little pillow, shirts from Otuś, but the older she was, the worse it was. Her first little dress was remade from a wall hanging of gray linen, but the little dress was sewn by a seamstress; I only embroidered stars on it. She later had more little dresses, but this one I remember the most. Grandma admired her wise, big eyes, but she remembers Grandma little because she was barely 2 years old when Grandma died. She often cried up to a year and a half; evidently she had some pains, but no wonder, sometimes from rye and [zuręta] they perish. Naturally she had no toys. I told her at the age of 3–4 how Oluś and Lila before the war would throw bananas and oranges under the bed—Ania asked insistently what those fruits looked and tasted like. I remember how once I got hold of bolted flour, and Ania did not want to eat noodles made from it, saying that she did not want such sticky noodles. In Zmigrod K/Jasło she was probably already about 4 years old, and although she was truly an extraordinarily smart little girl, she could not pronounce “r”. Mr. Kahl—a dairy worker—was terribly delighted and paid her for saying a little poem,
Black cow, in white dots
Ate the grass, twisting its muzzle
Damn it, where did so many "j"s come from here.
The Żmigród period is a separate stage for the whole family. I tried to send Ania to the nuns (in Żmigród) who ran something like a kindergarten. I gave her a bottle of milk, a slice of bread with butter (in Żmigród Tulu worked at a dairy that was run by Nusia), but Ania did not want to play with the other children and stopped going. The children played best together as a foursome: Ania, Otuś, Bogna, and Kazek Unold (I took him in from Hela, who at that time was teaching in Lezach near Borzęcin). Lila did not take part in these games. Sometimes the children went wild, and Ania led in this and always showed the greatest courage in these games. I remember when Mrs. Kruczkowska came to us (she also fled from Krzemieniec and lived near Jasło). Nusia, I, and Mrs. Kruczkowska couldn’t get done talking with each other—the younger children were playing, and Lila disappeared; after a while I found her behind a curtain in a corner (that hiding place served us as a clothes wardrobe), she was sitting hunched and crying.... because she could not endure that commotion, the loud talking. Our children were a little odd. I must return to Otuś, who fell ill with pneumonia again. Aunt Nusia had gone somewhere, I cooked dinners at her place for two households, I took care of Julek, Nusia’s husband, who was ill with tuberculosis. It was very hard for me to care for a bunch of children and two sick people. There was a doctor we knew, Dr. Rezacz (he was murdered by the Gestapo because he treated wounded “AK men”), and he prescribed and gave us prontosil and only aspirin. It seems that aspirin and cupping helped best. I must also write about the further “education” of the children, especially Ania. When fate cast us as far as Zawada near N. Sącz, we lived there with our relatives, the Zarębas. Wanting to repay them, I undertook to teach two of their children, Józka and Hania, to read and write. Besides that I took on for lessons two more neighbors’ children. Ania steadfastly kept pace with me in these lessons, although I basically did not teach her because at that time she was probably not quite 5 years old, and those other children were already 7. I did, however, have to buy her notebooks, and Otuś and Lila “assigned” her work. In a short time Ania was already reading newspapers, while those children were still “spelling out” from the primer.
Again I return to the Krzemieniec times, to my broken arm. It would have been a trifle in normal times, but in wartime it was a small tragedy. I obtained, for a piece of soap, 2 liters of buckwheat, but unground. It was early spring when I went with it to the millstones at some people we knew. I ground the buckwheat, an acquaintance woman sifted out the hulls for me and, in addition, gave me 2 liters of milk. Extremely delighted by this, I was hurrying back to get home before dark, and a stretch of the road led through the forest. I was going downhill and nose-first into ground covered with ice. I braced myself with my hand and it “snapped.” I went down to the main road, but I no longer stopped by home; I only handed the backpack with milk and flour to the children and called for Tulu, who was giving lessons to students working through high-school classes. Tulu led me to the hospital. My arm swelled up, and at the hospital they wanted to cut the sleeve of my fur coat—the only warm garment I had. I did not allow it—with difficulty they took off that fur coat for me, and the arm was set under anesthesia. The fracture was complicated and with displacement, but everything knit well, and to this day I feel no pains at all in this arm. I wore my arm in a cast for 6 weeks, and it was a nightmare, because I could neither comb the children nor myself, and I also wore two braids above my ears, which I tucked under, and that was my hairdo. Tulu combed us, but very unskillfully. Grandmother was no longer alive by then.
Christmas trees
I suppose that in those hard times I was very resourceful and I tried somehow to keep that “home” going, and for every Christmas there was a Christmas tree. During one Christmas under the German occupation there was an announcement that under no circumstances was it allowed to have a Christmas tree, and it was already a horror to bring one yourself from the forest. Two stubborn creatures, Gena Mojkowa and Gena Duda, went to the nearest German estate. In the park fence they found a hole and cut down in the park two beautiful Christmas trees. It was already late at night when each of us brought the children a Christmas tree. Great joy for us was the underground press. Often those little papers were barely holding together at the folds, after reading we would give them to a neighbor — naturally only a Polish woman. Various prophecies were copied out and they strengthened us very much — “hope is the mother of fools.” We still have them — maybe I will manage it, I will copy them for the children. Oh how we awaited the end of the war. My dearest dreams were to greet Polish soldiers in my thoughts, and deep down I was sure of this, and I considered the marching Germans from the very beginning to be defeated.
Somehow I managed to establish contact with Nusia, who was then in Zmigrod. For her it was a whole heaven better than for us, but she could not really come to our aid because packages from the Governorate could be sent of barely 25 dkg. Nusia sent me something like 2 times a little parcel with new stockings. Naturally I immediately sold them and with that money I bought an iron stove with one “burner”; it saved us very much because I set it up in the room and therefore at the same time it heated us and I could cook on it. I would have forgotten to write about one important thing. They gave us from the Słowacki Museum for safekeeping the manuscript of Balladyna. Słowacki’s handwriting was like little pearls, even, clear, on splendid paper. Besides that there were also poems there such as “Smutno mi, Boże,” which Słowacki illustrated with a pen. It can be seen that he was, in every sense of the word, an artist. I did not know where to keep this treasure. Among the books I was afraid that in case of a search they would find this manuscript, and after all, hiding it under the mattresses I was exposing it just the same. I wrapped it in linen cloth and from time to time looked through it. The only thing the Germans did not liquidate was the Słowacki Museum located in the manor in which Słowacki was born. (At present the Soviet authorities have made in this little house a library, and they put the exhibits in the form of furniture in the attic above the general museum. In this museum there is only a small room with two display cases in which there are some mementos of Słowacki). The curator under the Germans was Dr. Kryński, he was a cripple but a very educated man, he had a young and pretty wife. I was in this museum several times and I liked it there immensely, quiet, ideal order. By the little house apple trees grew, we would get apples from them. We were in Krzemieniec three years ago and we visited everything. It is clearly visible that they are destroying all mementos and traces of Polishness. If I am already on cultural matters, I must also mention the fate of the enormous library that was at the T. Czacki Lyceum. It contained all new publications and besides that the so-called black and white ravens of our literature. When the Bolsheviks entered Krzemieniec — Tulu was working in the Museum (he was head of the natural science department) so he had access to the lyceum buildings. He came once and, as they say, almost cried to me because he saw how the Bolsheviks lit a bonfire in the courtyard and were burning and tearing beautiful books. Tulu secretly brought some books but when we fled from Krzemieniec it all was lost. One fellow saved Słowacki’s manuscript (I did not remember his surname), who managed to get through to Warsaw. Word of the manuscript was lost. If it had stayed with us it would have been saved.
Further about the Museum. Before the war Tulu simply staked his life on collecting (he continues to do so now). As a little boy he started with matchboxes. Then he collected books, chemicals, plants and insects (at present stamps, newspapers, and of course books). He collected insects with great expertise and passion. The display cases were made for him by a carpenter at our expense. The insects had their antennae, legs set to tenths of a millimeter, larger insects were prepared, and, for example, caterpillars were inflated. At night we both hunted moths. Every walk was combined either with catching insects or with collecting plants. Even little Lila paid attention to insects which she called “eku”. I sometimes looked askance at it because we were not flush and the cases cost a lot. There were 32 of those cases. At the moment the war broke out Tulu concentrated those cases in the house. One room was entirely hung with them. In each case there was an ampoule with a moth-killing agent. The cases are very tight. When we fled from Krzemieniec Tulu gave those cases to the Museum “for safekeeping” and they have remained so to this day. When we were with Tulu three years ago we saw them — they are beautifully preserved. Tulu now intended to open them but I dissuaded him for fear lest, precisely after opening, bacteria get in there and destroy the insects. These are priceless collections. The whole satisfaction is in this, that the present workers treated Tulu with great respect and spoke of arranging a large exhibition of insects with Tulu’s portrait. Besides these cases there are also in the museum plants collected by Tulu. There are something around 2 thousand. The present employees write to us and asked Tulu who was the founder of the Museum, naturally the one murdered by the Germans, Prof. Mączak, and not Mr. Cynkałowski, who puts himself forward as the founder.
I cried my eyes out during our stay in Krzemieniec. I like Krzemieniec very much. Two of our children were born there, Grandmother’s grave is there. Lili was born in Żółkiew, which at present has been rechristened “Niesterow”. Everyone there welcomed us as guests, even Mrs. Turkowa, a rabid Ukrainian woman, gave us a jar of honey, but what of it when everyone is waiting for the Germans. For me all of this produced the impression as if I were in a grave. At moments it seemed to me that I could smell the odor of corpses, and everywhere dirty, ugly. Our relatives live in old, musty houses. Old Brody is one ruin, the roads rutted, holes, mud, dust. The trees cut down. Of Grandma’s little house not a trace. In general people there build very little and those new buildings are such contrived little houses, without fences. Shops, dirty, poor. People very badly dressed. Women neglected, obese. The trees cut down. Kremieniec relatively on the outside little destroyed and clean, for it owes this to academic congresses. Cemeteries overgrown — sinking in nettles, plaques torn from Polish graves. There are no Greek-Catholic churches, there are only Orthodox churches, only old women go to them. Working people, nor the youth, are not allowed to go to church. The Catholic church in Brody has been turned into a school of physical education. The lyceum church in Krzemieniec boarded up with planks. The Catholic parish church is open once a month. The monastery in Podkamień has been turned into a home for the insane. In Podkamień on the roads lie smashed beautiful statues of saints. Buses dirty, rickety. Eating houses disgusting. In the shops something of value can be gotten only for a bribe. I did not believe Tulu when he told about grain drying on the highways, until I saw it with my own eyes. Everyone drinks vodka. Divorces are the order of the day. I know that the present government does not care about these lands, but if the Ukrainians were more cultured it would not be so. I do not want to go there anymore. Tulu is drawn there but let him go alone.
Our escape from Krzemieniec.
At the “farm” we left Unold’s Maria. She too soon ran away after us, and the farm was taken over by Gena Majkowa. What happened to the furniture—I don’t know, and there was quite a lot of it, because three rooms were furnished. Part of the bedding, dishes and books we loaded into crates and trunks and left with neighbors “for safekeeping.” We had to flee—around Krzemieniec the Ukrainian rabble. In Krzemieniec the raging Germans. Tulu’s collaborators—Polish ones—were being picked out like peas by the Germans. Any day Tulu might not return from the museum home. The children had long been asking me for a kitten. Downstairs in the basement rooms lived a woman. Her cat had lovely kittens. I got one—beautiful gray. We named him Szaruś. The children did not want to leave the kitten in Krzemieniec and took him with them. Everyone later talked about the cat fleeing with us. Beforehand we were collecting the information, addresses needed during the escape. We had very little cash, because the Ukrainians did not want to buy, since they knew anyway that we would not take our belongings with us; besides, those hyenas had plenty from the Jews. We took with us the remnants of clothes, some bedding. Tulu took along many of his junk, like a microscope, some special mirror, tweezers, etc. Now Tulu says he took it unnecessarily, but then it was hard for him to part with it. The most important were the documents and photographs. I took the kettle that my mother bought me when I went to my position, and which still serves us to this day. We hired a cart and loaded our “estate.” The children also got on it with the kitten and a toy monkey; we with Tulu went on foot into the unknown, terrible. We did not receive a permit to leave, but at the railway station we got onto the train without a ticket. In the same compartment some Germans were sitting, but pretended not to see us. Thus we reached Dubno. We pulled out our bundles and set up camp in the waiting room. Supposedly some railwayman there was to place us in a train bound for Brody, where Tulu’s brother—Aldek—who was working on the railway at that time, was waiting for us, but here one train after another departs and we are sitting at the station. Tulu fainted. When I revived him, so, counsel to counsel, Tulu went to the railwaymen and showed them a gold five-ruble coin—it helped. They shoved us into a train, but what of it, when in Radziwiłłów they told us to get off. It was the border station between the so-called Ukraine and the General Government. The next station was already Brody, and in it Aldek. The station was empty and we alone, with a pile of bundles and with the children in the middle. A Polish railwayman came up to us and advised us to quickly leave the platform because when the shift came—and those were Ukrainians—we would be done for. We dragged as best we could the bundles and the children to the nearest house. We were lucky because it was the house of a Polish railwayman. He installed us in a room from which on the same day they had carried out to the cemetery the body of that railwayman’s son, murdered by the Ukrainians. Well into the afternoon a railwayman from Brody appeared, who took Lila and Otuś into a freight train to a railwaymen’s hut. He locked them in and I was terribly afraid of that separation. The children arrived safely; Aldek took them, who supposedly cried when he saw them. We remained alone with Ania in Radziwiłłów because our hosts were not there. Suddenly toward evening we heard shooting, and very close. We lay down on the floor under the windows and waited. Suddenly someone began banging at the windows; we were terribly frightened because we thought it was bandits, until we heard a voice: Mr. Duda—please open. That railwayman, young, tall, had come especially for us. He snatched Ania into his arms, and we only [took] the suitcase with documents and photographs, and we rushed after him to the locomotive waiting for us. On the tracks a German stopped us for a moment, but that railwayman answered energetically that he was rescuing us from bandits, and thus we reached the engine. They had come for us on purpose; supposedly that railwayman ferried many families to the General Government for evacuation and himself was killed. We got off at night before the station and went to the agreed house to sleep. In the morning we went to the Aldeks’ where Lila and Oluś were already waiting for us. Supposedly safe yet poor, homeless, helpless. All our belongings remained in Radziwiłłów and only later, when that railwayman was moving to Brody, did he transport our “treasures” as well. We obtained for a fee “fake” Kennkarten (equivalents of identity cards), and we were waiting for Nusia, who was to come for us from Zmigrod. When Nusia saw us she was disappointed, because she thought that, after all, the professor’s family would be arriving, and here we, with Tulu, were thin, blackened, dressed “God help us,” and three wretched children. We walked for the last time in the garden in old Brody, we slept under Tulu’s family roof. In this little house during the holidays Otuś was baptized. I used to come to this house in my maiden days and later as a married woman; in this house Lila stayed for some time under Grandma’s care. In this house Ania was for the first and last time. We ate fruit from trees that Tulu had planted. The cottage was charming. It had a little porch overgrown with vine, a vestibule from which one entered a room and a little kitchen on the right, and on the left there were two little rooms; these tiny rooms were separated by a thin partition not reaching the ceiling. The floors wooden, clean yellow, the walls white. In the garden lilacs, acacias, ash trees, fruit trees and lots of flowers. We had to say goodbye to the Aldeks (they then had three sons), to the little house and go on further—to Zmigrod near Jasło. The journey we had was horrible. In Lwów at Podzamcze we waited a long time and into the train came the stench of burned bodies. In the train unbelievable crowding, the children stood the whole time on the benches behind people’s backs. They held the kitten in their arms, who struggled out of their hands. With difficulty we reached Jasło, and from there by some truck to Zmigrod. Auntie’s apartment clean, cozy, calm, but unfortunately Julek—Nusia’s husband—was already then ill with tuberculosis. Tuberculosis had already seized his whole organism; he could no longer walk because his legs were also diseased. At Nusia’s there stayed at that time Julek’s sister, Zosia Mrożkowa—the mother of the later famous writer Mrożek. I remember that for supper there were then potato dumplings. I do not remember after how many days, probably the very next day we moved to “our own.” It was a single room in a post-Jewish house. Besides us two more families lived there, the Przewłockis and the Brożynas. They had two-room apartments. Mrs. Brożyna came from Zmigrod and they even had a piece of their own field. The Przewłockis were refugees. Mrs. Przewłocka worked in the dairy. Przewłocki wrote poems. The Brożynas had a little daughter Halinka, and the Przewłockis a little foster daughter Janeczka, sickly and very inappropriately dressed and brought up; during the front that child died. Tulu also worked in the dairy and then it was a food paradise. There was a lot of milk, we got cream and butter, there was bread and even meat. Nusia gave us some materials from which I sewed little coats for Ania and Lila; I outfitted Otuś and even Kazik Unold (he was also with us) from old clothes. I also sewed myself two dresses. In a word, a paradise compared with Krzemieniec. I remember my first trip to the seamstress who lived outside Zmigrod. I had to force myself to take that walk because in Krzemieniec it was impossible because of the Ukrainian bands. Just before the escape from Krzemieniec we slept with axes under the beds so as to defend ourselves in case of an attack. Already not far from us they murdered our acquaintance Górecki. Our “furniture” in Zmigrod was mostly made of sawmill offcuts, knocked together by Tulu. There were two “couches” and a cupboard of boards, and Nusia lent us one iron bed, a table, a small cupboard and a few chairs. It was not much bigger, or maybe the same size, as our current room. One couch would be taken during the day into the hallway. Kazik U. slept on it. He was supposed to be at Nusia’s, but I took him to us because the sick Jurek had to have peace and Kazek was terribly talkative; secondly, I did not want the starved, emaciated boy to be in contact with a consumptive. On the shelves, as usual where Tulu is, there already lay little stacks of newspapers. We lit a lamp. In the evenings we sat at the table, the cat walked under our chins or on our shoulders. I, as usual, did not idle; I often cooked dinners at Nusia’s, helped her to wash, clean; at our place too one had to scrub the floor, cook, etc. I taught Bogna and Otuś, and Lila even had a few piano lessons and went to school. I also traveled to Jasło with butter for the Germans; on that occasion I always carried something to trade, most often veal, cream, butter (this was Nusia’s goods), but also for us I took enough that for that merchandise a dentist repaired my and Lila’s teeth. These were dangerous trips because often at the entrance to Jasło the Germans searched us. I for this purpose would take Lila, and under the seat I hid the goods; in the back there were cases of butter for the warehouse. Nusia always waited in fear for our return. Tulu often took the children for walks—they picked bird cherry from which I made an excellent juice. Otuś again fell ill with pneumonia but, as usual, came out of it happily. The scourge was Julek’s illness. Nusia, as they say, “stood on her head” to save him, but implacable tuberculosis devoured him. He was a very handsome fellow, he was a teacher, but even before the war Father pulled him into the dairy (it was theirs). When the war broke out, Nusia with Julek took over a station in Zmigrod, and Julek’s parents stayed in Bożęcin. Kazik U. was in Zmigrod until First Communion, and he was the same age as Lila. This idyll did not last long—the front was approaching from the east. The Germans were having attacks of fury. The Home Army (A-K) had its hands full. Almost the entire Zmigrod intelligentsia belonged to the AK. By day they worked, at night they went on actions, and here the Germans were already ordering trenches to be dug. I, because of small children, was exempt from this. Tulu, as a dairy worker, as well. Some traitor betrayed the AK men. The Gestapo made a roundup on them. The front was already close—to Zmigrod a “theater” was coming; the “actresses” lodged in private homes. One of them lodged with the Brożynas, who belonged to the AK. Just in case he cut out under the floor a bit of earth in order to hide in case of a search. The night was sultry; we slept with the window open. Suddenly I hear: “Das Fenster zumachen, aber schnell.” I closed the window and the Gestapo were already pounding at the hallway door. Przewłocki opened for them and the Germans straight to us. They lit their flashlights, saw Tulu in bed and said “Gut, gut, der Mann ist zu Hause” and pulled out a list of those sentenced. They asked for Tulu’s surname, which, however, did not figure in their list. They nonetheless made a search and told Tulu to get dressed and took him to the Brożynas’. Brożyna, hearing the commotion at our place and in the hall, instantly jumped into the hole that was in the corner of the kitchen. In that place there stood a table covered with a tablecloth. The Germans smacked the “actress” in the face for not keeping an eye on Brożyna; they simply raged. They ordered Tulu and Przewłocki to toss over in the cellar a pile of coal. They prodded with bayonets every sheaf of straw in the attic. Brożyna disappeared and the house had already been under observation since dusk. They took Tulu and Przewłocki and ordered to be led to the indicated addresses. Tulu knew who was meant but luckily wriggled out, saying that he was a stranger, that he knew no one, and led them to such a house that was not on the list. They beat Tulu and told him to go home; Tulu came drenched in sweat because until the last moment he was sure they would kill him. My reaction was an unceasing scream. The Germans jumped at me and hushed me like a witch, and I surely looked like that because I was in a black slip and had disheveled hair. The next day they told me that with that screaming I had alarmed the neighboring houses and the suspects had fled. When they took Tulu I was already sure that I would never see him again. The Germans took Mrs. Brożyna and said that if her husband did not report himself by morning they would kill her. Tulu and Przewłocki were gone—I was left alone with the children and little Halinka Brożynówna. The Germans told us to leave the light on and every so often burst into the house together with the “actress.” Little Halinka had a cradle fastened to the floor—I had to sit by her and rock her. After some time I heard from the hole in the kitchen Brożyna’s voice, who asked me to give him clothing, because he was only in his shirt. Brożyna’s clothing lay in the kitchen, but I handed him another set from the wardrobe. Tulu came toward dawn—enormous relief. I told him about Brożyna. In the morning the lamenting family rushed in and took Halinka, but I told them nothing about Brożyna. Only when the guard from under the house left did I give him under the table some breakfast and some cigarettes, and Brożyna through the gardens escaped into the forest. Mrs. Brożyna and several other hostages were sent to the front to the kitchen—after some time they began to pester the soldiers and so they all returned home. Then there was the attempt on Hitler. Through Zmigrod the German army marched—I stood on the threshold and the soldiers waved their hands to me and called, “Mother! das Krüg ist cu ende.” Unfortunately for us, that was only when the “Krüg” began. During that roundup they took several people from Zmigrod and shot them. The front was drawing nearer—when the houses already began to shake from explosions, then Nusia and I did the greatest stupidity. We took the most valuable things, the sick Julek and the children, and went to Kąty (closer to the Dukla Pass) right on the Wisłoka, in the hope that the front would bypass us, and here it was quite the opposite.
Angles
We arrived one beautiful September day in Kąty. Sun, fruit on the trees. We set up a "camp" at an acquaintance farmer’s—Wokurka—in a new house under the mountain. Aunt Nusia drove us and turned back to Żmigród to save and secure property. Meanwhile the front instantly drew near and encompassed Kąty within its range. Part of the inhabitants together with the cattle took shelter in the forests, part in the vaulted cellars. We spread kilims on the floor and lay on it flat: the sick Julek, his six-year-old daughter Bogna, Tulu, I, Lila, Otuś and Ania. Our hosts fled to the forest. The house trembles from the explosion of shells, plaster falls from the walls and showers us with dust; the room is white from it. "Out of the blue" the first Soviet soldier enters the house, opens the window and sets up a machine gun in it and fires. I beg him to leave this house because there are children and a gravely ill man here. It did not help. He advised us to leave the house, but how—Julek was on crutches, small children, and out in the open bullets were whistling thickly. Where to go?! To the forest is too far, to some cellar we do not know how far. (The cellars were separate, almost completely dug into the ground, only the rounded roofs stuck up above the earth.) With a heavy heart we leave Julek (at his insistent requests), the children put on their little coats, we gathered only the suitcase with documents, and literally between the bullets we sneak, we run wanting to reach some cellar. We ran into probably [we] large ones and no one took us in. Under the little roof of one cellar a peasant stood; magnanimously he advised us to take cover by the root hollow of trees by the Wisłoka. Indeed, tall trees grow by the Wisłoka, we run down the steep bank and nestle into the hollow under the roots. Above us the Bolsheviks, on the opposite bank of the Wisłoka the Germans. Fighting! Bullets splash right at our feet as they fall into the water. At a certain moment, from behind the corner of a house on the other side of the Wisłoka, the figure of a German appears with a rifle ready to fire. I went numb because he was aiming in our direction. Perhaps he cottoned on that these were civilians with children—we remained alive. We sat under this root hollow almost until dusk. In the meantime Tulu "visited" Julek twice. Although the house was left without windowpanes, Julek nevertheless survived. Toward evening we got to the cellar of acquaintances. It was tiny; along one wall stood chests with the hosts’ clothing and bedding. We lined the free half with kilims. Two-thirds of the little cellar was a single bed on which sometimes 13–14 people slept side by side. Aside from the small children, no one could straighten their legs. Poor, tall, sick Julek! The little cellar, especially at night, shook to its foundations; right by the door heavy tanks drove past. If a shell were to hit the roof, we would all be buried. In the morning it was quieter. Then we would come out of the little cellar. Nusia and I would comb and wash the children. We cooked in the cottage, furtively in a hurry we peeled potatoes and even ground grain on the quern. We had fat in the form of clarified butter. Right before the offensive I bought a little piglet; naturally it stayed in Żmigród, but our acquaintance Jan Nowak (he is now a judge) killed it and brought us half to Kąty. We cooked "ein Topf" and only Julek ate separately, the rest from one pot. Kąty went back into German hands. All over the village the corpses of soldiers were lying around. Tulu had to bury them. In the neighboring house there was the so-called "Szreibsztuba". The Germans drove the civilians they caught to build a bridge which Soviet airplanes bombed. Tulu was driven there several times. The Germans were catching chickens all over Kąty, which they made me and Nusia pluck. One time I started cursing, calling the Germans "Szwaby" and the like. One of them, who was dozing leaning against the table in the kitchen, understood Polish; he sprang at me with a revolver—I ran to the cellar—the German after me; only Tulu blocked his way and began to excuse me—it worked, because the German waved his hand and left. Among the Germans hanging around, there were also cultured ones and even with a heart. Am I not overdoing it with that heart? But the fact remains—One of these Germans almost every day took Ania in his arms, took her to the supply-truck and loaded her up either with sugar or with some canned goods. The front dragged on; for us it was ages. We decided to get out of Kąty. But how? To the point from which one could leave the front by a military vehicle was far, especially for the sick and limping Julek, and then on top of that small children and a few odds and ends. Nusia found out that the German on whom our fate depended was celebrating a name day or a birthday. She picked some autumn flowers from neighboring gardens and went to offer congratulations. She came back with the promise that they would take us out of Kąty; only we had to get to the point on our own. On foot it was impossible, because Julek was lame, small children, odds and ends. Some means of transport depended on the commander of the "szreibsztube". It was up to me to procure that wagon. I went to the German and he set about making advances—luckily a frontline soldier came to report and that saved me. We got the wagon. We loaded it with our belongings, we seated the sick Julek and little Anusia on it, Lila, Oluś and Bogna clung to the back of the wagon and rode standing. We had not gone far when the Soviets began to shell the road with hurricane fire. It was hell. We snatched Ania, helped Julek get down in a flash, and took shelter in the nearest cellar. Meanwhile our carter drove the horses with our belongings to the place from which the trucks were leaving. Again a terrible problem: how to get there with the sick Julek and small children. Not far away there was an improvised dressing station. Nusia and I went there. The chief doctor, furious, lived essentially on black coffee and cigarettes because he was constantly performing amputations on wounded Germans. We somehow pleaded with someone from the auxiliary staff and they gave us an ambulance in which Julek arrived. The children and we went on foot. Our things were piled up in an empty barn—again an attack. Lila and Otuś were then in the barn and the tiles from it were cascading down onto the yard. Naturally we came out of that too unharmed, but just to bury us completely, a downpour started, mud up to the ankles, and through this mud we carried the odds and ends to the truck waiting for us. When the children clambered under the truck’s canopy, literally a puddle formed next to each of them. None of the children, nor even we, so much as sneezed. At last we drove beyond the front line—one felt almost foolish in that silence. They brought us late at night to some place and we found ourselves in an empty room with straw and hay on the floor. The Germans who were sitting in further rooms gave us hot black coffee and we lay down to sleep side by side. In the morning we set out on the further journey. The driver was a bit tipsy and wanted to deliver us right to the house in Turza near Gorlice. In this house lived Julek’s brother, a teacher in Turza. Right before the very destination this ride would have ended tragically. The road was slippery, clayey, led uphill; on the left and right side a steep drop, the so-called "paryje". The car was right at the edge of the precipice when Ania raised a terrible scream and the ill-fated driver stopped the engine. We got out carefully so that the car would not tip over, and partly on foot, partly on the wagon brought by Kazik Kędzior, we reached the intended place. Nusia with Julek and Bogna lived in a tiny room at Kazik’s, and we not far away at a widow’s.
Stay in Turza.
Aunt Nusia did what she could to get food and nursed her sick husband. We were healthy, but each day was very hard to get through. I bartered the remnants of rags for food, I went to dig potatoes, Tulu went to the forest for firewood. Digging was hard work for me. The peasants would gather and conduct the potato digging for one another. They were, compared to me, well-fed and strong, and I wanted to come out with honor and kept up with them as best I could. For daily work I received two meals and a basket of potatoes. The women saw that it was hard for me and then left me in the kitchen, where I cooked a hearty supper for an average of 15–20 people. Our landlady along with her sons was lousy; lice did not spare us either. The village was relatively rich, and despite the contingents people did not starve. Lila began to attend school in Turza. When the teacher asked the children what each had eaten for breakfast—Lila said “dziamę,” because that is what the mixture was called there. All the children laughed at Lila. We had no help from anywhere. I felt that I would not endure long in Turza. One day I went to Sącz on reconnaissance. I rode a freight train in the booth with a railwayman, and again amorous advances, from which I barely wriggled out. It was probably after about 10–12 years that I came to Sącz then. I cried and laughed by turns walking along the streets. I went to our “street.” Our “house” stood. I went in to strangers, into “our” apartment. It was something like a “Fata Morgana” in the desert. An elusive mirage. Then I went to Zawada K/N.Sącza, in which to this day live relatives of my Father: the Zarębas and the Kumors told us that they would take us in. I do not remember how I got from N.Sącza to Gorlice, from where on foot I reached Turza (about 10 km). After arriving in Turza I went to the village head to ask for a cart. He did not give one. He explained that if we did not leave, they would have to support us, because we already had nothing, and we probably would not die of hunger and cold. He did not give it, and yet most of the peasants, and Turza is a large village, had horses. The village head magnanimously advised us to go along with the Germans who would come here for hay. We had no other way out, and at the appointed time we drove up with our landlady’s cart (the cart was pulled by cows) to the village head’s house. We were there around 11 and we left already after dark. At the village head’s there was the smell of fried scrambled eggs, there was bread and milk on the table, and we left on dry bread. The Germans loaded 2 carts with hay “up to the ceiling.” On the bottom of one they put our belongings (a kilim, a bit of bedding, photographs, documents, and remnants of clothes). On [the other] we barely managed to cling on, and swaying we set off on the road. The Germans, probably by order, sang almost the entire way the Polish anthem, naturally mangling it badly—they were losing and therefore were becoming “Polish patriots.” We arrived around midnight to Gorlice. The Germans unloaded the hay somewhere else, and there our “property” remained as well. We stayed with the Germans in quarters. They treated us to hot coffee and bread. In the morning we began to look around for a means of transportation—to Sącz. The railway was out because we did not get a pass. We stood a long time on the road until one German agreed to go for the children and our things and take us back to N.Sącz. We had remnants of vodka and bacon and promised that to the driver. We arrived in Sącz—we got off at the market—the German looked at us and did not take payment. I went to Mrs. Doroszukowa at 3 Różana Street. Unfortunately she was not at home, the children, locked in, were looking out through the window onto the balcony. While waiting for Mrs. Doroszukowa we went down to the cobbler who had his workshop on the ground floor. Exhausted to the last limits, I told him a few bitter words of truth about certain Poles. This great patriot took offense and did not even treat us to water. Mrs. Doroszukowa arrived, fed us “with whatever the cottage was rich,” and at her place there was poverty. We slept one night and in the morning I went to Zawada, from where I came by cart and took the family to the relatives.
Obstacle.
We first lived with the Kumors. They were a childless couple. They were bringing up Mietek Fręczek, whose mother—the sister of Mrs. Kumor—died when Mietek was still a little boy. Mrs. Kumor is a Zarębianka by birth—the daughter of my father's sister. Kumor is an old, conceited man. He treated us like intruders—who disturbed his peace. They had three rooms; they gave us the smallest little room right next to the kitchen, without a stove. At first we ate together; the fare was very simple, but that was a trifle, everything tasted good to us. It was worse that Kumor wanted to get rid of us.On the opposite side of the road lived Józef and Maria Zaręba. Józef is also the son of my father's sister. They had as many as 9 children. They were relatively well-off because they had 25 morgs of land and a piece of forest, but they were terribly exhausted by the war. However, they were much more warm-hearted than Kumor, who moreover was the wójt and could really help us. The Zarębas whitewashed a room for us, lent us two beds, a trestle table, a bench, and two folding chairs, and again we had our own "home."I tried to obtain food as much as possible on my own—Kumor looked down on us. He did not believe that Tulu had been a professor at the Krzemieniec Lyceum, and I a teacher. Once I baked cookies with saccharin, made tea, and invited Kumor. On that occasion I showed him our diplomas; the youngest, five-year-old Ania, put on a demonstration of reading a newspaper for him, and we impressed Mr. wójt a little. He arranged a larger flour allotment for us and wooden clogs for Tulu. Mrs. Kumor gave us 1 liter of wonderful milk (for 5 people). I went to the cellars for potatoes as if to my own. The Christmas holidays were splendid because there was plenty of bread, there was even a roll, some meat in the form of a chicken earned by me. The Christmas tree was decorated with sugar cubes in tissue paper wrappers. I was at the name day at yet another Zarębianka, Ludmiła; that too was a childless marriage, also "oaken," but at her place I ate my fill of sausage and cake, and I got tipsy on moonshine. In order to repay the Zarębas, the most decent of all those relatives, I taught their two children, Hanka and Józek, to write and read (at present Hanka finished a vocational tailoring school, married, has a beautiful house and 3 children. Józek is preparing for his master's examination in part-time studies). On the occasion of teaching the Zarębas, two more neighbor children came to the lessons, and Ania also studied. All this lasted not quite 3 months, because in January 1945 (exactly January 20). Just a few days earlier some German unit arrived in Zawada, which carried to the Kumors a whole, slaughtered piglet. They did not manage to eat it; they had to flee. Mrs. Kumor called me to "dress" it. For the first time in my life I took on such a job. I took Tulu's razor and shaved the piglet with it, and then they helped me split it. I got a whole half from the Kumors. I gave a quarter to the Zarębas and a quarter remained for us. It was a splendid feast. Night fell; again bullets across the yard whistled like swallows.I had to go to the well for water and a bullet literally flew past right by my ear. We piled into the cellar with the Zarębas, but we spent only one night in it. I could not sit still and kept going out of the cellar and observing the battle. Zawada is on a hill. Below, Nowy Sącz; the sky was dark navy, densely lit up by shells. One dreadful nightmare—the Germans—were gone. In the morning Bolshevik units entered Zawada. At the Zarębas' and the Kumors' there were swarms of them. They literally stole from under one's hands, they raped women. I, by virtue of speaking the Ukrainian language, often had to intervene in various matters at the neighbors'. At the Kumors' the captain himself took up quarters, of which Kumor was extremely proud. They gave up to him the best room, in which there was a chest of drawers, and in it, locked in a drawer, two gold wedding rings, a gold chain, and a large gold pocket watch. The "gentleman" captain had to go on to Berlin, but before that he pried up the top of the chest of drawers and took "as a souvenir" all the gold. There was an innumerable quantity of such various cases of theft. During the war operations the beautiful castle of Sącz was blown up. The castle was blown up on the orders of the Bolshevik troops, quite unnecessarily. In my youth various celebrations were held in the castle courtyard. In the halls exhibitions of paintings by such painters as Reguły, or the excellent portraitist Barbacki (he was killed at the hands of the Germans as a hostage) were organized. In the little grove surrounding the castle I picked honey mushrooms and russulas. The Germans blew up the bridge over the Dunajec. The end of the bridge along which I used to walk with my dad as a child, and then with my girlfriends, and with Tulu as my fiancé. I saw from the bank how the Soviets were laying a pontoon bridge. The winter was mild, the water high, turbid. A soldier before my eyes fell in and drowned, and no one tried to save him. In a short time they "patched" and pieced the old bridge together, and in that state it had to serve the people for a few more years. After it was dismantled the parts were taken to Opole and there it still serves people. For us very normal times had already come. Tulu already in January began teaching. He walked from Zawada on foot in wooden clogs; often his entire day's food was a plate of "dziamy" with milk. Lessons were held in various houses all over the city; there were also classes in the tenement in which we had lived before the war. Lila began to attend the 6th grade in Zawada, and Otuś the 2nd, Otuś had a nice navy suit (reworked from Tulu's), and therefore I dressed him, to protect the clothing, in a "cobbler's" smock, until Otuś rebelled and no longer wanted to go to school in a smock. In the spring the children spent whole days tearing around outdoors. One time Otuś and Ania fell into the manure slurry. In Zawada too Ania and Otuś came down with whooping cough; Ania, in particular, went through it hard. I began to look around for an apartment in the city. It was extremely difficult. Marysia Korpińska (a former friend of ours from the same street) advised me that at Helena, Chełmiecka 3 there is a post-Jewish little house in which people from Poznań are living and who are returning to their parts. I went to the Housing Office and they assigned it to us. Unfortunately, in the meantime Mrs. Sekułowa quickly moved into it with her three sons and did not want to budge from it. I asked at the city hall that I be assigned some other apartment, but they said they would sue that lady and she would have to move out. The case went to court and Mrs. Sekułowa got an order to move out. (She had a sister on the same street, Mrs. Cieślowa, and she had an apartment with her) but that didn't help, and Tulu every day walked kilometers from Zawada. I had a "brilliant" idea: I loaded our belongings onto a cart and we moved into half the little house through the window (the little house had three tiny rooms and a kitchen). Only then did Mrs. Sekułowa move into an apartment at her sister's, and then into a beautiful apartment in the gmina.
Chełmiecka 3.
It was a little house made up of 3 little rooms, a kitchen and a large veranda. It also had a small garden patch. Tulu taught—I of necessity only kept house—because they offered me a teaching post far out in the village—they didn’t want to give me one in Sącz. It was hard in every respect, both financially and in terms of all conveniences. A long way to fetch water, kerosene lighting. In the apartment the “furniture” consisted of two beds from Zawada (each different), I borrowed [another] simple wooden bed from a former schoolmate and that was the “bedroom”, an iron one stood in the other little room. There was trouble with straw mattresses because for straw one had to go all the way to Zawada. The “whatnots” were made out of UNRRA boxes (these were packages sent by the USA for the starving population) precisely “United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration”, an international organization formed in the USA in 1943 under the banner of providing economic aid to the populations of countries destroyed by the war, dissolved in 1947. The curtains hung on strings. The second room had an iron bed, a huge table from the Jesuits’ dormitory, and chairs which the students carried in for us, with two nightstands. Tulu procured somewhere at school a huge wardrobe, which served us both as a wardrobe for clothes and partly as a pantry. We ourselves with Tulu whitewashed the apartment (later every year Hania came from Zawada, or Józia Kulawa’s mother—Przybyłowa). The garden with two apple trees was important; I bought some 2 bushes of “smorodyn”. I was very happy with this garden and put a lot of work into it. Tutu earned little. I walked to Zawada for potatoes. They never delivered even a measure to me, perhaps later when we were buying 3–6 m. for the winter and 2–3 kop of cabbage. I dug those potatoes for free myself and of course loaded myself with them like a horse—a backpack completely full and two bags—and walked with that 6 km one way. Often I literally had nothing to give the children for supper and then, I remember, on the long June days we would already go to bed. I gave private lessons. Various mothers also came asking for influence with Tulu. They wanted to give something—I excused myself and inwardly asked God that they insist and leave the present. Food queues were like a continuation of the war, it was a plague. They allotted 1 kg and sometimes even ½ kg of sugar or flour and stand there for hours in line for it! The children didn’t want to stand. They often pushed me out of the queue—I had to argue, our children were cross with me on this account. When they introduced ration cards for food it was a bit better, but there was too little of it to stop standing in queues altogether. With clothing, a nightmare. Marysia Korpińska worked with American relief and about 3 times brought a few little clothes in a handbag. Sometimes Aunt Hela (she worked in Kudowa and her eldest son Kazik attended our high school and later all three boys were with us) sent some German “rags” and that’s how we managed, but step by step it was better and better. We were about 2 times with the children in Kudowa at Hela’s, who had, compared to us, a beautiful apartment, so much so that we didn’t want to return from her to our junk. I very often had headaches, in general in the afternoons I felt like “peas by the path”. Otuś probably worried about it the most and sometimes late at night brought me pain pills from the neighbors. These were probably all the effects of wartime experiences and hard work. When the gate creaked, I went rigid with terror. The displaced doctor Isterewicz ordered me to lie “flat as a pancake”, measure my pulse and take some medicines. This whole “affair” was before Easter, then from bed I directed the children—Lila kneaded and baked the cake. I rested—I got over it and often afterward it seemed to me that there was no job I wouldn’t manage. And I had that work because already on Chełmiecka Street almost without interruption besides our children there were at first 2 of Hela’s boys and later three. Naturally neither a washing machine, nor water nor light. To make ends meet I rented a piece of field from Bastowa—our milkwoman. The stay was diversified by Hela’s visits—first with the children and then to the children. I remember that for one holiday I started early to set aside flour and sugar and I then baked cakes from 30 kg of flour. It wasn’t much at all for six children. Iwonka was only born on 30-X 1949. For the girls, or for Lila, I sewed coats from blankets. One Christmas Eve was with borscht with soap. In winter we ran the kitchen in one room. A makeshift iron stove, one table the children sat around, a kerosene lamp, dark. In haste I laid the ladle on the soap which stuck to it and fell into the borscht. There was always a lot of fish for the holidays—it was the cheapest “Dunajec fish.” For Christmas Eve we sat on a bench, on the bed, on two chairs, on crates. Tulu took out several of his tweezers for removing fish bones. There was always kutia and apple strudel.
The children helped me a lot—there were weekly duties, the older ones also had to carry water, light the stove, sweep, run errands.
30-X-1948 Iwonka was born. Maybe it was a reaction after the war or maybe self-defense against approaching old age; enough that we all rejoiced at Iwonka’s birth. I looked up her names in the calendar. The whole family knew that we would have a child. There was a solemn christening. The godmother was Hela and the godfather Olek—my siblings. The children went to school, left for vacations, I stayed alone. The aunts picked out her name “Iwonka” and that’s what we called her and still call her to this day. Only when enrolling in school did I find out what Tulu had actually given her for names: Urszula–Elżbieta. That was Tulu’s beloved “Koszulka,” as Tulu called her. Before Iwonka was born we often went together to the Chełmiec forest or to Klimkówka—to the forests of my youth. I am very fond of orchids and when I saw them for the first time after the war in the Sącz forest I even screamed with joy. We went to Rytro, Głębokie. These are also places I used to go even in childhood. It was hard, there was a lot of work, but the house was pleasant, the little street quiet. We kept dogs, first there was “Ksenia.” The children were heading to that library and burst into the house screaming that Ksenia was dead. They cried terribly—a Soviet car ran over her. The second dog was a splendid German Shepherd—Rex. He went bathing with us, he went for walks. The end of the idyll came when our house was bought by the barber Jurkowski. Some Jew heir turned up and sold the house. From that moment on Jurkowski kept visiting us. He would strip the apple trees, pile some junk in the yard. He fixed the roof, until finally he put out poison for the dog. We tried to save him. We went with him to the vet, gave him milk to drink, and the dog recovered. But not for long, because when he did it to him a second time, nothing helped. This Jurkowski was worse than cattle. Then he kept coming to get us to swap apartments with him. He tormented us so much that we finally decided to. We gave him a cultivated garden, a clean apartment, and he [gave us] a bedbug-infested apartment, and a terrible yard because Jurkowski kept pigs and a cow. That yard was one big dung heap. Work in the garden simply carried me away. We filled in the dung heap, we dug over the whole yard and the garden in front of the house. At first we had all vegetables in abundance, later there was less because a sycamore grew and large apple trees and shaded part of the garden. There were so many flowers that when there was no money for bread Olek and Alek went to the market and sold them. Still, the financial situation was difficult, and so I bought little piglets, raised them .... in the .... cellar and after some time called the butcher. Kazik and Lila were already at university. When the piglet was turned into kishka and sausage, both we and the children in Kraków had something to eat. Just when Iwonka was 6 we let ourselves be tempted once more by a little dog. It was a little German Shepherd like a ball. He grew up together with the children too, he was their darling, and especially Iwonka adored him. Tragedy befell him already at the present apartment. They poisoned him. I went on a trip with Tulu and Iwonka was alone at home, she experienced it terribly. I don’t want any dog or cat anymore. Szaruś, that kitten from Krzemieniec, also died of poison. In general Sącz people are bad—they threw us out of food queues and threw us out of two houses, they poisoned our dogs, they cut down that pretty little tree we planted, they covered the flowers with sand.
Hela moved in with us permanently, together with furniture—I threw out those cobbled-together junk pieces and it was already so-so at home but the overcrowding was terrible; in the first year on Helena there were 10 of us. In summer it was half a misery because the little attic room saved us, but winter was awful. Along with that a chronic lack of money, because Hela at first worked as a quartermaster in the dormitory and earned very little. From morning to night Tulu taught (at times he had over 60 hours a week) but it was all too little, especially when autumn came when the house had to be supplied with fuel, with potatoes, with cabbage, shoes for the children, coats. Usually when I went to town across the bridge I cried, or prayed to find some money or that someone from America would send us some. Lila and Kazek already at university, Olek finishing high school, Radek and Ania catching up to him. I rented a field from Bastowa for potatoes and once I even sowed wheat, but I had an awful lot of trouble with it. Hela and I washed and dyed old clothes and remade them into new ones. At last we hit on an idea and started embroidering blouses, dresses, collars. Tulu helped us with this because he drew new patterns and printed them off. Lila also had her share in this. Sometimes we embroidered through whole nights. So as not to fall asleep, in the summer we embroidered by the open window and on that occasion listened to nightingales.
At last Hela moved to her own apartment, which she obtained with great difficulty. She took part of the furniture and then we bought on installments a light dining-room suite. I was terribly happy with it. Hela left the piano but only for the time being—Iwonka played it and a bit Ania and even Lila when she came to Poland from England. Well, the time came for the piano too—because Kazek Unold took it. I felt sad because since childhood a piano had been my dream. Violins wear me out when someone “saws” them. I like a string orchestra. I like the piano enormously, I just can’t stand banging on the keys. I stood on my head and bought an old piano for 11,000 zł. That piano stands there because Iwonka is away from home and when she comes she plays very little. Lila is not here. Nor Otuś. Ania far away. The piano is to be taken by Iwonka. Such was our happiness—our lot—that we could not warm a place for long anywhere and the little house on Helena had to be left. That little house was cracked, the fissure was visible through and through, but Borus had his kennel there, there were those few beds. Our landlord sold the house to Ms. Wróblówna. She bought it very cheaply and began to persecute us so that we would move. We submitted an application to the housing office, we did not want a private house, anyway to where? The housing commissions said that we had sufficient square footage, we wrote stacks of applications—in vain, and in the meantime Wróblówna first cut down that lovely maple I had planted, then she covered the flowers in the garden with sand, she tore up a piece of ceiling in the basement, so that the floor in the room next to the kitchen lay only on joists for some long winters. On top of that the stoves smoked, I swept out soot twice a year. It was so cold in the apartment that in winter the water in the kitchen constantly froze. What were we to do?! Renovate? With what money? For whom? When Lila came with little Romuś (the second time) Wróblówna had a hole dug next to the house supposedly to check the condition of the foundations—we were afraid that Romuś would fall in there. After Lila left I hit on the idea not to whitewash the apartment, not to plug the gaps with plaster but with cotton wool. It looked awful. With difficulty I called a sanitary commission in winter, which recognized these conditions as inhuman, but again the ordinary housing commission ruled that all these “deficiencies” were removable. “And so around and around, Mr. Maciej.” This wrangling disgusted me terribly!! Wróblówna was obliged to give us an apartment, but she was a SWINE in every sense of the word. That well-off, single woman. When they finally assigned us an apartment she didn’t want to give a penny either for paying the deposit (6,000 zł), for the move, or for the apple trees planted by us. We then became very indebted, both with the ZNP and with the ORS (Installment Sales Service). If not for Tulu’s student—Furtek—the costs of the move would also have been added. There was a great problem with the piles of books, newspapers and other clutter that Tulu simply would not get rid of, and the little apartment was 46 square meters + a small cellar. I hit on the idea and with my own money, with the administration’s consent, I enclosed the storage space under the stairs; now we have two little cellars; into one we stuffed piles of books and newspapers, the other serves as a handy storeroom. Who and when will make use of those newspapers and old books? Water, a bathroom and radiators are a wonderful thing but the surroundings are awful—a kolkhoz. Our block is in the very middle. There is no balcony—Not an hour can one do without drapes in the evening and in the day without curtains. Smoke from the boiler room pours between the blocks as if through a chimney. Trampled lawns, children’s screams. In the little house on Helena, when I embroidered at night by the open window, I heard the nightingales sing. I long for greenery, for a garden bed, and what weighs on me in addition is that Tulu feels very bad, especially in winter when they fire the boiler rooms and because of Biegonice. What a terrible mistake, an irreparable loss, those Biegonice. They built there a factory of cathode electrodes (distance about 4 km from Sącz). The explanation is that the main motive was to relieve unemployment, and what turned out?! Not even 2,000 people were employed. Unemployment still exists, they “displaced” hundreds of farmers, and the land is fertile, beautiful. If instead of that factory they had built, for example, a vacation-tourism complex, how much greater the benefit would have been. I would blow that factory up. In the apartment flowers don’t want to grow. Besides, our girls say that potted flowers heat up the apartment. Personally I would throw out half the junk and make metal trellises, partition the apartment and hang everything with flowers. I must get flower boxes at least to have flowers in the summer. And how did poor Borus feel! But at least the dog had us. We went out with him for walks. I don’t want to describe how he died! Why don’t people understand that people can love a dog, a cat! Besides, these are Sącz people! I am ashamed that I was born here. I have the impression that since they were throwing us out of houses, poisoning the animals, they would poison us too to have more space for themselves. Before we moved here I went for close to two months every day and painted and cleaned the apartment. Now I keep moving the furniture because I want to introduce a little variety into the prison. They were going to bring in gas and new expenses. Now, as I am copying this for Lila, the gas is already in, it cost about 10,000 zł. It is a convenience, but running it cost an enormous amount of health and energy because the workers botch, drink and demand bribes.
I haven’t written anything about the floods on Helena. We lived through one flood on Chełmiecka. The water flooded the street, the garden, it only pushed under the threshold. I took the children and went to a relative on “Paścią Górę.” That relative (he is no longer alive) was a forester. From there we watched the flood, there we ate splendid venison (I prefer not to think of the little roe deer that was shot). We lived through two floods and several flood alerts at the second apartment, and since the house had basements, they were always flooded almost to the ceilings. During one flood Ania didn’t manage to leave for her practicum because the water tore up the railway lines and she came back home with a suitcase on her shoulder, wading down the little street nearly up to her waist in water. The boys rode a bathtub and a washtub along the little street. When the water subsided we had to carry tons of silt out of the basements. With us it still wasn’t so terribly bad. From the railway track I saw houses by the Dunajec flooded with roaring, murky water up to the roofs. Soldiers were taking people out on pontoons. They waited to return to their homes at the gmina office whose building stood by the main road (now there are private apartments there). With us, too, the Lup family installed themselves. When it rained for several days in a row, there was already an alarm. We brought up from downstairs a supply of coal, carried all the wood upstairs. We carted drinking water from the well, I bought bread and sugar, potatoes, and we waited for the flood. We went out in raincoats to watch how the water was rising in the Dunajec. At home it was damp and “atmospheric.” Iwonka was very afraid, and all night she kept asking how much the water had gone down, and it was quite the opposite—the water was rising. Here there are no floods, but there is almost daily a flood of smoke.
People of Sącz.
There is talk that in former times, when the people of Sącz turned to the people of Stary Sącz (a little town 7 km from Sącz) with a request to borrow the gallows, they were refused, being told that they had it for themselves and their children. This is, in general, the mentality of the local people. Right after the war I applied at the inspectorate for a job in Nowy Sącz. I was refused and was offered one in the countryside. Tulu taught at the high school, the children went to high school, there was no transportation. The roads were terrible. To live in the countryside with the younger children and run two households?! So I had to resign and we had to live on Tulu’s single meager pay. In Sącz only their own people worked. Tulu probably wouldn’t have gotten a job either, but he had already started it in January 1946, and there was a lack of staff with higher education.
Only with great patronage (our neighbor Janas was an inspector) did I get in ’58 a job in Biczyce; it was a contract. Buses were already running; besides, I rode a bicycle as much as I possibly could. My zeal knew no bounds; I had longed for this work for years. I also studied on my own, because during the years of “unemployment” I had forgotten many things while doing drudge work. In Biczyce I organized plays, excursions, I had good results, and that may have contributed to my getting a job in Chełmiec, and this time a permanent post. In Chełmiec it was drudgery! Every year I painted benches, doors, windows, I laid out gardens, I bought aquariums with my own money, teaching aids especially for history. I staged plays (for one play the decorations and costume designs were made for me by Lila, who happened to come then from England). That performance even made it into the press. At the performance—or rather the staging of the poetry of M. Konopnicka—old people cried, even teachers. I read to the children “from cover to cover” Pan Tadeusz, Sienkiewicz, and finally I was building the school. A school had to be built there sooner or later, but my efforts above all accelerated the construction by a good several years. The conditions there were awful. The children were crammed into a former C.K. Austrian building at a road intersection. When cars drove by, the ceilings shook, until once a failure occurred; there was a threat of complete collapse of one ceiling. They shut down the large classrooms upstairs and 2 on the ground floor. In order to get any additional rooms, we had to stage a march with the children to the Pres. of the County Nat. Council; I argued, I was the initiator. They flew in from the party and finally gave us the keys to an old three-room granary. One classroom had only one window. The children were going blind. I took pictures of those “objects” and, having faithfully described the conditions (the meeting with the authorities took place in the evening at the Firehouse, so in any case no one would have bestirred themselves to come to the school), I supported my words with the photos, which I handed to the authorities. A pity I didn’t keep them as a memento. After that meeting a School Building Committee was formed, and I myself put forward my candidacy for secretary. The whole family helped me in drafting various letters. Otuś helped me a great deal, as by virtue of serving as a clerk in the spatial planning department he knew the plans for the expansion of Chełmiec, etc. There were many opponents of building a new school—various intrigues and adversities could not be written down even on an oxhide—but at last the construction of the school was approved, and in that same year the laying of the foundations was begun. Within a year a beautiful 12-room school was built. Such disgust with those people overcame me, however, that I moved to Nowy Sącz. I received a job at Primary School No. 13 – Practice. This is a promotion, but there is also an enormous amount of work and very poor premises conditions.
Since I am already on this subject, I will add also my transition to retirement. It was not voluntary despite 64 years of age. They forced me onto it, because I felt well and the teaching profession is my life’s passion. Anticipating my dismissal, I submitted an application to the inspectorate and the board of education with a request to continue employing me. Nothing helped. I copy here my application
Board of the School District
of Krakow in Krakow.
On 29 May 1972, I received from the Department of Education in N. Sącz a letter notifying me of my transfer to retirement.
I hereby lodge an appeal against this decision for the following reasons:
I started rewriting that application and gave up. Nothing! They fired me, period. Just one more thing on this subject. When I was defending myself like a lion against going into retirement, one of the teachers told me: "It's hard, age comes and one must go. For railwaymen, as soon as they hit 60 they must absolutely go." I was indignant at such a comparison and said that if a writer hits 60 then he is not allowed to write, a poet to create, a painter to paint.
I at least fought for this much, that for a relatively too short period, because only 21 years of work, I was receiving a not much smaller pension than Tulu. Tulu has 2420 zł – I 2379 zł. Maybe now I will still manage to devote time not so much to the children as at least to the grandchildren! The children and I! Lila was 6 years old, Otuś only 2 when the war began. Ania was born at the beginning of the war, Iwonka a short time after the war, and all my effort was directed primarily not so much to raising as to keeping the children alive. When the situation already began to improve, basically the children had already grown up and began to leave home one by one. I did not have time to bring them up in an organized, thought-out way; besides, the children seemed to me such a part of me, simply my whole, that I often caught myself as if they had been together with me from my earliest years, that they feel and think as I do. My father wrote into such a book - a diary m.p. "He who gets up early, the Lord God gives him good things" "By truthfulness you will pass through the world" "Love of the Fatherland and honor are the most important good" etc. I read Rodziewiczówna, Kraszewski, Sienkiewicz, Mickiewicz, Słowacki, Konopnicka. The ideals of those writers became my ideals. I was foolish and I am foolish, although so-called honest. I wrote many things taking place already after the war, well but those are, well, consequences of the war.
I would still like to write a lot about the children, about their youthful years, about studies and life as adults. There is one thing that cannot be changed, namely that their worries, their life arouses in me a constant fear; often they drive sleep from my eyes. Although many things make me happy, although I would like at least to embroider some pretty things, because that is really all I know how to do (I don't know how to play, I don't know how to paint), in the end I would rather just die in order to stop forever being afraid and worrying about the children.
[Erased almost illegible lament about children]
We took ... a plot of land in order to somehow hold on. Our children are good, but a bit aloof and they don’t even like one looking at them, and as for touching them, God forbid. You can’t say anything affectionate either. I go around like a fool and pretend that I don’t care about them, that everything is all right; what I am writing now will also be criticized and poorly received. Lila once told me that in England, and generally in the West, as soon as children grow up a bit they part ways with their parents and hardly take any interest in them. Does it work like that? I know that more than once I made mistakes in our mutual relations, but I never did anything wrong deliberately. Who knows—maybe Otuś will not be very concerned with the children, but I don’t know whether Lila will be indifferent to how Romuś is arranging his life. I know, Liluś, that you traverse not only thousands of kilometers to be in Poland, but also to see us. Forgive me that sometimes, in anger, I blurted out something foolish; I have regretted every bad word and I regret it. I regret that I watch television when you are here; I do it deliberately, as if it were nothing since you will soon be leaving. And again I would like to sleep through this time so as not to fear a mishap during your journey. Dad has it a thousand times better, for, supposedly a fatalist, he is a thousand times more of an optimist than I am. When you were little, Liluś, and the doctor stated you had enlarged hilar glands, then as soon as I went out onto the street I cried out of fear for you. That’s what a scaredy-cat I am. I know that for you, Lilu, every trip to Poland is connected with disappointment. When one longs, one idealizes everything, and here we, both of us with Dad, are getting older, and with age we acquire many various habits, faults, unpleasant changes in appearance and in how we move. Well then, youth has its rights, and old age cannot have them?
At the end I wrote a few “stupidities,” and mainly because of that I dragged my feet about handing over this “diary,” and I felt like cutting out the last pages, but here you have it, Lilu.
Mama.
