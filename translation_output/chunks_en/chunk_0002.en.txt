I think in those hard times I was very resourceful and I tried somehow to keep that “home” going, and for every holiday there was a Christmas tree. One Christmas under the German occupation there was an announcement that under no circumstances was one allowed to have a Christmas tree, and it was considered a horror to bring one oneself from the forest. Two stubborn creatures, Gena Mojkowa and Gena Duda, went to the nearest German estate. In the park fence they found a hole and cut down two beautiful Christmas trees in the park. It was already late at night when each of us brought the children a tree. A great joy for us was the underground press. Often those little papers were barely holding together at the folds; after reading, we passed them on to a neighbor—naturally only to a Polish woman. We used to copy out various prophecies and they heartened us very much—“hope is the mother of fools”. We still have them—if I manage, I will copy them out for the children. Oh, how we awaited the end of the war. My dearest daydreams were of greeting Polish soldiers in my thoughts, and deep down I was sure of it, and from the start I regarded the marching Germans as defeated.
Somehow I managed to get in touch with Nusia, who was then in Zmigrodzie. She was doing a whole heaven better than we were, but she couldn’t really help us much because from the General Government one could send packages of barely 25 dkg. Nusia sent me something like twice a small parcel with new stockings. Naturally I sold them at once, and with that money I bought a small iron stove with one “burner”; it helped us a great deal, because I set it up in the room and so it warmed us and at the same time I could cook on it. I almost forgot to write about one important thing. They gave us from the Muzeum Słowackiego for safekeeping the manuscript of Balladyna. Słowacki’s handwriting was like pearls—regular, clear, on splendid paper. Besides that there were also poems there, such as “Smutno mi Boże,” which Słowacki illustrated in pen. You could see he was an artist in every sense of the word. I didn’t know where to keep that treasure. Among the books I was afraid that in the event of a search they would find the manuscript, and yet by hiding it under the mattresses I was exposing it just the same. I wrapped it in linen cloth and from time to time looked through it. The only thing the Germans did not liquidate was the Muzeum Słowackiego located in the manor where Słowacki was born. (At present the Soviet authorities have made a library in that little house, and the exhibits in the form of furniture they have stored in the attic over the general museum. In that museum there is only a small room with two display cases in which there are some mementos of Słowacki). The curator under the Germans was Dr. Kryński; he was disabled but a very educated man, and he had a young and pretty wife. I was in that museum a few times and I liked it immensely there: quiet, perfect order. Apple trees grew by the house; we used to get apples from them. We were in Krzemieniec three years ago and saw everything. You can clearly see they are destroying all mementos and traces of Polishness. Since I am already on cultural matters, I must also mention the fate of the enormous library that was at the Liceum im. T. Czackiego. It held all the new publications and, in addition, the so‑called black and white ravens of our literature [rarities]. When the Bolsheviks entered Krzemieniec—Tulu was working at the Museum (he was head of the natural history department), so he had access to the Lyceum buildings—he came one time and, as one says, almost cried to me, because he had seen the Bolsheviks light a bonfire in the courtyard and burn and tear beautiful books. Tulu secretly brought out some books, but when we fled Krzemieniec it was all lost. One fellow (I didn’t remember his surname) rescued Słowacki’s manuscript and managed to get to Warsaw. All trace of the manuscript was lost. If it had stayed with us it would have survived.
More about the Museum. Before the war Tulu practically devoted his life to collecting (and he still does now). As a little boy he started with matchboxes. Then he collected books, chemicals, plants, and insects (now stamps, newspapers, and of course books). He collected insects with great expertise and passion. A carpenter made him display cases at our expense. The antennae and legs were set to tenths of a millimeter; larger insects were mounted, and caterpillars, for example, were inflated. At night we both hunted moths. Every walk was combined either with catching insects or gathering plants. Even little Lila would notice insects, which she called “eku.” Sometimes I looked askance at it, because money was tight and the cases cost a lot. There were 32 display cases. At the outbreak of the war Tulu consolidated those cases at home. One room was completely hung with them. In each case there was a vial with a moth‑killing agent. The cases are very airtight. When we fled Krzemieniec, Tulu gave those cases to the Museum “for safekeeping,” and so they have remained to this day. When we were with Tulu three years ago, we saw them—they are beautifully preserved. Tulu now intended to open them, but I advised him against it for fear that precisely after opening, bacteria would get in and destroy the insects. These are priceless collections. The only consolation in this is that the current staff treated Tulu with great respect and spoke of organizing a large exhibition of insects with Tulu’s portrait. Besides those cases, there are also in the museum plants collected by Tulu—about two thousand. The current staff write to us and have been asking Tulu who was the founder of the Museum—naturally the one murdered by the Germans, Prof. Mączak, and not Mr Cynkałowski, who claims to be the founder.
I cried my eyes out during our stay in Krzemieniec. I like Krzemieniec very much. Two of our children were born there; Babcia’s grave is there. Lili was born in Żółkiew, which is now renamed “Niesterow.” Everyone there welcomed us like guests; even Mrs Turkowa, a fierce Ukrainian, gave us a jar of honey—but what of it when everyone is waiting for the Germans. For me all this gave the impression as if I were living in a grave. At moments it seemed to me I could smell corpses. And everywhere dirty, ugly. Our relatives live in old, musty houses. Old Brody is one ruin—roads rutted, holes, mud, dust. Trees cut down. Of Babcia’s little house not a trace. In general people there build very little, and those new buildings are such contrived little houses, without fences. Shops dirty, wretched. People very badly dressed. Women neglected, obese. Trees cut down. Kremieniec is, outwardly, relatively little damaged and clean, for which it owes the academic congresses. Cemeteries overgrown—drowning in nettles, plaques torn off Polish graves. There are no Greek Catholic churches; there are only Orthodox churches, and only old women go to them. Working people and the young are not allowed to go to church. The Catholic church in Brody has been turned into a school of physical education. The Lyceum church in Krzemieniec is boarded up with planks. The parish Catholic church is open once a month. The monastery in Podkamień has been turned into a home for the insane. In Podkamień, beautiful statues of saints lie smashed along the roads. Buses dirty, rickety. Eateries disgusting. In the shops anything of value can be obtained only with a bribe. I didn’t believe Tulu when he told me about grain drying on the roads, until I saw it with my own eyes. Everyone drinks vodka. Divorces are an everyday occurrence. I know the present government in those lands doesn’t care, but if the Ukrainians were more cultured it wouldn’t be like this. I don’t want to go there anymore. Tulu is drawn there, but let him go alone.
