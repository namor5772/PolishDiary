    Me and the war.

Maybe it is a funny title: "Me and the War", but as I set about writing down these memories, I wanted to present my personal feelings and the history of my closest family during the war and after it ended. Composition of my closest family: I was 32 in ’39. Tulu (my husband) 36. My husband’s mother (Babcia) 70, the eldest daughter Lila 6, son Otuś 2, Ania was born 11-X-1939. There was also a girl — a domestic help — Hela. We lived then in Krzemieniec on Objazdowa Street. Tulu was a teacher at the Liceum im. T. Czackiego in Krzemieniec and the head of the natural history department in "Muzeum Ziemi Krzemienieckiej". I was not teaching then.
In May 1939 the children fell ill with scarlet fever — actually it seemingly has no connection with the war and yet. The children were gravely ill, especially Otuś, and then I made a resolve that if the children recovered, I would give to the church what I had most precious — our wedding rings. The war broke out — the government announced an appeal to replenish the national treasury, so we offered those rings as a gift. More than once we talked about how someone surely took them and fled (thousands of people were fleeing) across the border, but deep in my heart I did not repent and do not repent of that step. My children and Poland are one. I remember how we did not leave the loudspeaker when the Germans occupied Czechoslovakia, when the announcer bade farewell to the listeners, when the Czechoslovak anthem was played for the last time. I cried then and began to realize the horror approaching us too, to Poland.
1-IX-1939 mobilization was announced. I will not list exact dates here, only the facts, experiences that fixed themselves in my memory like images on a durable and precise plate. In the first days of September (or perhaps at the end of August) Tadzik’s mother (now my son-in-law) stopped by us on her way from Teremne for some treatment and asked for advice on what to do, whether to go or to return home. I advised her to return home, and so she did.
Tulu received a double pay for two months, with which I bought some food like flour, sugar, fat, cocoa (with that cocoa I long enlivened my Anusia’s eating). I put those provisions in Babcia’s padlocked trunk and added to that a rather handsome amount of preserves and syrups I had made in the summer, and we waited for the war — the war in Krzemieniec, the war in our home. Events unfolded like an avalanche. People flowed through our house and our yard as in a kaleidoscope.
The yard was full of cars. Refugees from western and central Poland were fleeing in droves through Krzemieniec and Zeleszczyki to Romania. At night the road leading through Dubieńska Rogatka (a suburb of Krzemieniec) looked like a shining snake — the light of vehicles, an unbroken stream. The hum of vehicles reached the apartment. On one fair day (probably around 11 September 1939) no one expected a bombing. The refugees had dispersed with food purchases and there was plenty of it on the market then (the peasants had already heard about the approaching Soviet troops and supposed that their farms would be collectivized, and therefore were selling off their belongings). With the wave of refugees a girl about 12 years old made it to Krzemieniec. She was entirely without family — we took her in — her name was Janka. On that beautiful morning, after conferring with Babcia, we sent Janka to the market for plums for kneble. Tulu went to report or hand our radio into the police, and then the bombing began. German airplanes lowered themselves right over the market packed with people and directly strafed the populace with machine guns. At the same time they bombed the whole main street, even the cemetery suffered severely. Many people died then. The girl — Janka jumped into the nearest entryway, in which from fear she sat almost until the evening. Tulu in the abandoned police building lay down under a window and came back safe and sound. I was pregnant with Ania (Ania was born 11-X 39), I snatched up 2‑year‑old Otuś in my arms, Lila by the hand, and calling Babcia I ran and took shelter in the so‑called "Skałki Dziewicze." There were many people there from nearby houses. Babcia was beside herself and ran into the apartment and stayed at home. When afterwards we found ourselves all at home — I with the children and Tulu, we began to worry about Janka. Tulu went to the market and somehow found her and brought her home. From that day on one alarm followed another. We took shelter in the cellar, but in the end we did not react to the sirens and sat normally in the house, only little Lilusia sat in the cellar all day long and, green with fear, kept pulling us all down there. Finally the alarms ceased, word spread among the people that Soviet troops were approaching. The end of Poland and, as the Ukrainians said, "Poland is busted". A new partition of Poland followed — the Russians and the Germans divided Her. I cried terribly, but I bustled about the house, scrubbing and weeping. One of the refugees, Marek — a miner — began to console me that he was in a worse situation because he was cut off from his family and the Germans were already there, and after all the World would not leave us like this. We already found out that England also had declared war. We had been waiting since 1-IX-1939 for the end of the war, the end of the war from day to day. Already from the first days of September there began to circulate prophecies, suppositions, that in a month, in 60 days, in 3 months it would be the end. That somewhere the Polish nation and army were resisting the Germans, etc., etc. I forgot to write that during the last prewar vacation Kazik Unold stayed with us — Hela my sister — the mother of Kazik was at a teacher’s course in Zaolzie. She dropped in on us at the beginning of September and took Kazik and in accordance with the orders of the Polish governmentwent went to Podlis near Kowle to teach. It was a terrible Ukrainian village. Some of its inhabitants already in September were robbing and killing refugees and Polish soldiers. By lucky chance nothing happened to Hela — she was tried by the entire population of the village — they had nothing against Her, and presiding over that trial was a political commissar of the Soviet army who was of Polish origin. Hela even became the headmistress of a 10‑year school. I had heard a lot about the Bolshevik army and wanted to see it. The Ukrainians erected triumphal arches for them, greeted them with bread and salt. They marched down the main street of Krzemieniec. The soldiers, short, thin, haggard, in helmets that covered half their faces. The Ukrainian neighbors, instead of looking at them — looked at me, and tears choked me.
Life in Krzemieniec slowly began to go back to normal. Some of the Polish refugees returned to their places in the Gubernatorstwo, others — especially men — fled across the border — mostly to Romania. Yet others were deported to Siberia, and the remnants of the Polish Army were taken prisoner by the Russians. Some were murdered at once by the Ukrainians.
One of those who tried to get across the border was Witold Duda — Lolek. He visited us in Krzemieniec around 15-X-1939, said goodbye ("under Poland" he was the head of the post office in Stalowa Wola and a reserve lieutenant) and set out toward Zdeszczyki. At the border he was caught by the Soviets and deported to a penal camp in the Komii Republic. Since I am writing about him already, I will finish His story. Only after a year did he write us a laconic card from the camp saying that he was healthy. That was all the news about him during the war. Only after the war did we get in touch with him and find out how he survived. We, after receiving the card, prepared a package (rusks with eggs and milk, garlic, linden blossoms, and some bacon) and with great difficulty sent it — I rode with it as far as Smyga near Krzemieniec — the Bolsheviks hindered the sending of packages (The weight of the shipment could not exceed 2 kg). Every time they designated different sending points and  times. That package supposedly saved his life because he was already dying of hunger. When an agreement between Stalin and Sikorski was reached — Lotek joined the Anders’ Army. Along the way he married Danka Musiałówna who had also been deported to Siberia. Lotek fought in Italy near Ancona. He left the army after the war in the capacity of a captain. He was in England and then went to Argentina, to Barilosze. He has a son, Andrzej, who is now already married, and an adopted little daughter. Now he would gladly return to Poland.
But back to us. My childbirth was approaching. The yard had emptied of refugees. The girl we took in left for her parents. On 9-X snow fell unexpectedly. I, fearing that the vegetables would freeze in the garden was digging them out from under the snow and carrying them, wet and heavy to the cellar, and that may have hastened the birth. Around 12 at night I sent Tulu for the midwife. Babcia felt unwell, so I lit the fire under the stove myself, put water on, prepared the swaddling blanket and little shirts. Before the midwife washed her hands — Anusia came into the world. A brave, smart girl. Brave to the point of risk. She has already been on two "women’s voyages" (there were four women), at present as I am writing this she is sailing only with Krysia on a small club yacht across the Baltic to the Gulf of Finland. I always worried about her and now enormously because on the previous voyage they narrowly escaped with their lives. At first Babcia was saddened that it was not a boy, but after a few days Anusia pleased her greatly. I lay in bed for only 3 days and that in fits and starts, because I had to bathe and diaper the child myself — the midwife did not come and Babcia was afraid.
After Anusia was born beautiful weather set in. It was then that Tulu’s brother Lotek dropped in on us. Tulu taught in two Ukrainian schools. Polish schools were abolished. I was a "chadziajka domowa [homemaker/housekeeper]". To keep, or rather feed the family was no small art. For everything you had to stand in queues and those were enormous because a lot of Jews had fled to Krzemieniec from the Gubernatorstwo. I sometimes would line up at midnight in order to bring 25 dkg of sugar or at most ½ kg, and often I returned empty-handed. Sometimes I managed to obtain some candies (very bad ones) and then there were feasts because even the grown-ups could then drink tea "na prekusku [with something on the side]". Sugar was only for the children. For bread queues. I mostly brought home wholemeal bread — we like wholemeal but the children, especially little Ania, did not like it. For flour — queues, for salt — queues. Polish textiles disappeared like camphor. Some was already bought up in September, and the rest was confiscated and exported by the Bolshevik authorities. From time to time shipments came through from Russia, but these were incredibly poor materials. Mostly printed percales, already worn and shabby. I once bought a few meters (after standing in an enormous queue) — Babcia sewed pajamas for the children, and for myself I sewed a dress. The pajamas frayed in the very first wash, and my dress looked like a raga fter the first queue.In the queue they tore the dress, too. I borrowed 1 safety pin and that’s how I came home. There was no laundry soap. I made lye from ash and soaped the dirtier parts of the linen lightly with toilet soap, because that could be bought from time to time. Bed linen would get dirty on both sides. Tulu mostly wore light-colored shirts with sleeves, and it was torment to wash them — of course by the traditional method in the washtub and by hand.
For milk the peasants did not want to take money, so I gave from the house coats, shoes, curtains, because milk had to be for the children. Fuel disappeared, and already almost from the very beginning of the war until the moment of our flight from Krzemieniec we burned whatever I dragged from the forest or stole from the surrounding fences. In the forest I searched for the longest branches possible, tied the thicker end, put it over my shoulder and dragged it home. My left shoulder was swollen and sore. In the vicinity of Krzemieniec there was peat but they sold it only to Ukrainians or to those who worked at it. I went, too, to Sapanów. I worked literally on bread and water. I slept at a peasant’s on hay, and by then it was already dangerous because the peasants were preparing to murder Poles. I stacked peat in small piles on a measured area. In the evening I could not straighten my back, and from the tips of my fingers blood came. In spite of everything I endured a dozen or so days and brought home big carts of peat. That was a treasure because winter was approaching and I no longer had the strength to go to the forest. I brought that peat just before the war between the USSR and Germany and under the German occupation. A Pole simply had no right to go to the forest, because from both the Germans and the Ukrainians death threatened. Lucky that Babcia was at home, who took care of the children, because I was constantly "on the go"—now at queues, now for exchanging clothing for food, now to the forest for wood.
Until the war with Germany we were terribly afraid of deportation to Siberia. At first they deported families of military men, policemen, forest service, higher officials, families of suspects, and to them we belonged, because Tulu’s brother—Witold—was in a penal camp in Siberia. All Poles were "suspect" because even refugees from the Gubernatorstwo. Fearing deportation I constantly kept on hand bread rusks, dry macaroni, and I breast-fed Ania until a year and a half. Since Tulu worked, it was hard with a christening, and besides we were waiting for the end of the war and then the christening would be solemn in the circle of the family. Meanwhile the end of the war did not come and Ania grew, so as a year-and-a-half-old girl she went on foot with Babcia and me to the church. Our acquaintance Mr. Werner and Balcia "held" her at the baptism. I write in quotation marks "held" because I remember that Ania, in a long cream dress altered from my prewar ball gown, stood alone on a chest in the sacristy. Ania was already then running and talking well. Despite hard times Ania thrived. She began to walk in the ninth month. Babcia rejoiced greatly that she had become the godmother, after the other babcia (my mother) she received a name that I like very much—Joanna. I, as I already mentioned, was constantly busy, flustered, whereas Babcia told the children lovely fairy tales of her own invention, read to them, fed them. I, too, read to them a bit, especially the rhymes of Porazińska. I remember that to almost all the rhymes I made up melodies and read them "singingly" and later when I taught I also "sang" in the first grades. Lilusia had just before the war passed her first entrance exam to the 1st grade of the practice school at the Lyceum. Naturally she passed it well, especially as regards colors. In September 1939 Lila began to go to the first grade, but since "Polska Topła" the language of instruction was Ukrainian and Lila did not know it at all—and besides we were expecting the end of the war any day—so we took Lila out. I remember that classes were held on Sundays, too, and that put me off as well, and Lila stayed at home. I taught her intermittently to read and write—she learned quickly, with arithmetic it went harder, but only now do I realize that Lila was a clever girl, because she learned the four operations within 20 and later 100 without concrete materials and greater explanations. Little Otuś listened to fairy tales and rode a lot with Daddy on the bicycle. Otuś was born already with black hair—I was a brunette too—and when I walked with Otuś, everyone took us for Jews. The children had only a few toys. Just before the war Oluś got a little monkey, and with that monkey we fled from Krzemieniec; that monkey was still hanging around on Helena in Sącz. I regret that I did not keep it. Instead of toys the children had many little books, paints, paper, crayons. Otuś early began to draw tiny little people—the whole sheets teemed with [drawing of a stick figure] and I sang to them
I’m just a beggar, beggar
What will I eat, eat
I’ll go to the little market
I’ll buy a wee little loaf of bread
I’ll eat it,eat
" " " .
Those were the dearest moments in those macabre times. One could not reconcile oneself to the fact that everything was "Topło" [warm], as the Ukrainians said. It seemed to me that I would keep it all together if the house were clean. I don't know where my strength, energy came from. The first Easter holidays were approaching. I baked some little cakes and bought from clandestine slaughter a quarter of a pig. I made a lot of sausages. I polished the floors I washed the runners. These were the most splendid holidays of the entire war. There was even spirytus in the house, which Tulu had received from a distribution from Muzeum Ziemi Krzemienieckiej.For that spirytus I received products from the peasants. Tulu slept in a separate room, beside him he had a pile of books because he was preparing for lessons. I with the children and Babcia in the bedroom. At midnight I hear the sounds of bells on a sleigh (although it was the Easter holidays, snow [was falling] - the holidays were in March). It was the time of deportations to Sybir. Someone is pounding on the door from the courtyard side. I open in my nightshirt and several Bolshevik soldiers burst into the apartment. One stood by the door with a rifle and the rest dispersed through the apartment. Tulu berat. They made a search they looked through the books. Babcia was somehow unwell and was trembling with fear, begging the soldiers for her son's life. Then .... they ordered that they be given wódka (I diluted with juice our whole stock of spirytus), I served the remnants of meat, bacon, garlic and onion. They drank, ate, wrestled among themselves and in doing so made a mess in the whole house and at dawn they left. With difficulty I brought the apartment into order.
The matter of the relatives - the Majków.
At the beginning of the war, Gena Majkowa - Tula’s cousin - wrote to us. She wrote that her husband Adam - head of the school in Małoryta near Chełm Lubelski - had died, She - (his wife) - was left without means of subsistence with three children. After deliberation we wrote her a letter to come to us, that somehow together we would push poverty. In spite of the war I had the flat clean, floors waxed, clean bedding. We took her in as our own to the beds, to the common kitchen. After not long I realized that from them lice overran us, and from that time almost the whole war lice and lice, and here a lack of soap, [soda] both under the Bolsheviks and the Germans. The second matter was shared food. Genia did not want to give up good food. She pouted when, for example, milk soups were half and half with water, when I divided the meat among several dinners. The third matter was her eldest son, Tadzik. This boy at the beginning of the war was about 14 and habitually stole. He robbed us, he robbed his mother, “hustled” acquaintances, invoking kinship with us. I suppose that it was the parents’ fault. He was one of twins. His brother died, and over Tadzik the parents trembled and allowed him everything. At the time when they came to us, Tadzik was about 14, Krysia about 3 years old, and Ceśiu about 2 years. At that time we occupied 3 rooms, a balcony and a kitchen. I cannot stand this Tadek, I separated myself - giving them one room and a place in the kitchen. Genia went to work at the brewery. We could, however, have lived together under one roof if not for Tadek. Even the Militia came to us on account of Tadek. There was no help — we had to move out. The owners of a vacant apartment demanded the rent for half a year in advance. For that purpose we sold my gold watch, an “Omega”, Tula’s suit, we added from Tula’s pay and we moved. We were, as they say, completely “broke”, without money, without food but in the house on ul. Lipowa there was peace. Not for long, however, for the war between the Germans and the Z P P R came.
On ul. Lipowa we lived upstairs. We also had 3 rooms, a balcony, a little kitchen. One little room was hung with beautiful small display cases with insects. The cases were made by a carpenter according to Tula’s design, at our expense. The collections were beautiful; they remained in the Krzemieniec museum. The work and worth truly priceless. Since I met Tula he constantly collected something; there was not a single excursion that would take place without some purpose, and above all catching insects and collecting plants. At night we also went with white sheets and flashlights for moths. All our property remained in Krzemieniec: insects, plant collections, books, paintings, furniture, dishes, bedding.
Germans
One day Tulu came back from a conference and said that something was “afoot” and that the inspector, a Russian, was calming the teachers and they advised them to go for a walk up to Górę Bonę (there were and still are ruins of Bona’s castle there. From this hill there stretches a beautiful view over Krzemieniec and the nearest environs). The next day, a stir in the town. At home there was nothing to eat. I took Ania in my arms and stood awhile in the “queue” for bread. I was standing on Szeroka Street when suddenly shooting began, two Germans on a motorcycle appeared on the street, Fortunately Tulu came out of the house, found me, snatched Ania into his arms and we jumped into the brook flowing right behind the houses. The streets instantly emptied. We made our way upstream along the brook, ran across Szeroka Street, jumped onto our little street and into the house, but without bread, which from then on we constantly lacked, from then on hunger came to our home. One enemy fled — the other seized us. The Soviets, just before the Germans entered, massacred all the prisoners. People came back from the prison in tears, and some recognized among the murdered — their own relatives, acquaintances — by the bestial manner [in which they had been killed].
Hunger under the German occupation
Tulu worked at the Museum, in an institution which the Germans only seemingly tolerated and in fact tried to destroy. They would issue, e.g., orders to vacate the existing museum rooms within a single day. The staff frantically searched for the next premises and carried the exhibits themselves on their backs. I remember that Tulu earned so much that for a whole month’s “salary” one could buy on the black market “one kg of butter.” It was sacrificial work, but the museum survived and exists to this day together with Tulu’s insect display cases and the enormous collections of plants.
Food rations were not enough even to maintain one person, and here we had to feed three children and three adults.I would bring once a week ¾ of a barley loaf, which we ate at once (the next day it turned bitter and crumbled like sawdust), a little of disgusting marmalade, and from time to time a dozen or so dekagrams of meat. Everything in the house I traded for food. Coats, curtains, leather briefcases (people made shoes out of them), paintings. For Babcia’s black coat with a sealskin collar I got nearly one meter of wheat. It was a treasure. We ground that golden grain on quern-stones concealed from the Germans. I made from the flour [zalewka], dumplings, and to the bran I added grated red beets and baked cakes on the stove. The mother of our landlords, who was staying in the countryside with a pop’s son, learned about this wheat. She asked to borrow that wheat because she wanted to grind a larger amount, and that she would bring some from the village right away and return it to us. She took it and that was the last we saw of her. That was inhuman, for the Ukrainians were the Germans’ favorites and had food in abundance. I traded, e.g., beautiful curtains for 25 kg of millet groats. For an entire month, apart from that groats and 1 liter of milk a day, we ate nothing else. I got 30 liters of milk for two beautiful, hand-embroidered pictures of the Mother of God and Our Lord Jesus. On his way home from work Tulu secretly got 2–3 sugar beets from which I baked, with the addition of bran, cakes, or I boiled down “honey.” Another time I traded some rag for a little rye, which Tulu and I ground on the museum quern. For a time I kept two pupils, the pop’s children, “as boarders.” The payment was food: a few potatoes, some flour and bacon. It was paradise, but it lasted briefly, for the pop took the children away from the Poles. For some time Mr. Niedźwiecki lived with us; he had family in the village and so had his own food, he paid us something for the lodging, but I would pilfer from him “this and that.” I remember that once, famished, I ate a piece of cold cuts but fell terribly ill—“stolen goods do not fatten.” That Mr. Niedźwiecki was a great patriot; he went to Warsaw, took part in the uprising, and supposedly was killed. I write “went” but these were escapes at the risk of life. Tulu brought caustic soda from the Museum, and so we made soap. Soap was made not only from tallow—which was very hard to get—but also from eggs, from hens, from carrion with the addition of peas for better foaming. With this “goods” I went around the villages and bartered it for whatever I could, and it was already dangerous—the Ukrainians were preparing to murder Poles. Tatu got a bucket of salt from the Museum (I don’t know how that salt got there). The then director was a Ukrainian, he could have given us more but preferred to give to his own; some even got a meter of salt. Salt, too, was lacking under the German occupation. That salt also helped us a little. I remember that once I traded one glass of salt for a hen. Unfortunately the hen either fell ill with us, or the woman had already given us a sick one. I could not reconcile myself to the loss of the hen.I drenched her with water so she would come to, and poured sour milk into her beak, and I cured the hen. Formerly my neighbor, a Ukrainian woman, did the poultry-killing for me; now she did not want to do that for a Pole. Tulu accomplished that deed. He took the hen and on the chopping block cut off its head, but he came out of the shed so pale that I never again turned to Him in such a matter. And we had to share this food with one Jewish woman as well. The Germans—or rather the Ukrainian militia—drove the Jews from the ghetto to work. On the way one Jewish woman would drop in to us asking for food. I always gave her something, whether a few potatoes or a handful of some groats. One time I literally had nothing in the house and as proof I showed her the peelings from the last potatoes. The peelings were very thin (as we say here, that Kraków could be seen through them), and at the Jewish woman’s request I gave them to her. In general potatoes were a delicacy. I usually cooked them in their jackets. One time I had only a few, too few to eat them by themselves. So I made pierogi from them, and since I had only rye flour, I kneaded dough from it; I “greased” the pierogi with onion browned in a little cream. The children were v. satisfied, and Lila even wrote about it in her little diary (it got lost somewhere, and that’s a great pity). Once we got from a museum co-worker some poor plums (it was Obolończyk—he is now a doctor in Kyiv). I also kneaded dough from wholemeal flour and made “knedle,” I poured over them saccharin dissolved in water, Otuś called to his peer Dzidka Targońska from the balcony or the window that at our place there were knedle for dinner. Tulu got a bit of food by going on his bicycle to Chodak to Hela. He brought from Her some cabbage, a little groats. The rides were dangerous because the Ukrainians were by then in earnest preparing to go after the Poles. Tulu lengthened his route and circled around the villages. Once he took his winter coat to a peasant to trade. He got for it a goose and a little honey—there was a feast for several days. Sometimes one of the Unolds would come to us—(Jan from Szumska or Apolinary from Chodak). They almost always brought meat from a clandestine slaughter to sell. I distributed it among acquaintances. That was a very dangerous affair for those times. For such things the Germans punished even by death. For ourselves I kept the scraps, for which I also paid them. All in all we might not have had to suffer hunger, for They (the Unolds) lived in the country and had it in plenty. But the sated do not believe the hungry, and They perished. Our drinks were tea from scorched apple peelings, from linden blossom or wild strawberry leaves. Probably the one from wild strawberry leaves was the best. I also tried to make acorn coffee from scorched halves, but it was Sisyphean labor because I could never grind them or even crush them in a mortar. I have gone on so about this hunger, but it was an enormous problem, which in fact rested on me.
The Death of Babcia Dudowa
This is actually connected with that hunger. Grandma was full of life and if not for the war she would have lived much longer. She liked meat, fats, and then suddenly hunger, so she declined greatly in strength. One time Julek Unold (ciocia Hela’s husband) came to Krzemieniec with a consignment of tobacco. He stopped by us and persuaded me to go to Chodak (40 km) so I could bring myself back some food. I pulled out the last scraps of clothes for barter and am just about to go, when Grandma makes a scene at me for leaving them alone. I explain that after all I’ll bring home some slab bacon, flour, butter, but Grandma is still angry. I was already downstairs and about to get onto the cart, but “something touched me,” I turned back and said a heartfelt goodbye to Grandma. To this day I regret that I left then, for Grandma would have lived longer. In Chodaki I exchanged clothes mainly for fat and every day I went to the hand-mill to grind wheat, because Julek told me that as much of it as I ground I could take with me to Krzemieniec. The two of us went, Hela and I (Hela was then pregnant with Alek), because they too were milling for themselves on the hand-mill. I was terribly impatient, and then that neighbor, who was also supposed to go with the tobacco contingent, delayed departure because the Germans would not allow leaving Chodak. Only after about 10 days did I leave Chodak, and on the road I received in Szumska a telegram that Grandma had died. It was at the end of winter. The apartment cold. You went to the kitchen through the hall - the kitchen over the stairs. Grandma warmed herself by the stove in the room, and she would go out to the kitchen to cook something for the children, and she must have caught pneumonia. Before Tulu realized and called a doctor, it was already too late. If I had been there, perhaps she wouldn’t have caught a chill, or I would have put cupping glasses on Grandma at once and they would have saved her. I cried enormously, and I am sorry for her to this day. I know that if she were alive she would now be around 100, but I grieve that she does not watch television, does not listen to music, and she was v. musical. She does not rejoice in the grandchildren — or perhaps she does?! I beg my mother for care over my children, and maybe Her, Babcia Dudowa, too, to ask her for it? Tulu and I set up a little monument on Her grave (three years ago in 1970), and somehow I feel lighter. In life she would go for a walk to the “Cmentarz Tunicki,” sit on Słowacki’s mother’s grave and say to Lila that she would bring Her (Grandma) flowers, because she wanted to be buried here. So it came to pass - Her grave is located right next to the grave of Salomea Słowacka. I remember that I sewed from my red sweater leggings for Ania (from the sleeves) and for Otus (from the back). The children (Ania and Oluś) had no sense of death and chased each other around the catafalque. Balcia’s old accordion was left in the trunk in Krzemieniec.
Jews
We lived lately upstairs in such a little villa, and downstairs Jews moved in right after the Germans entered. It was a very wealthy, childless family. They wanted to leave some things with us. But Tulu absolutely would not agree. One time when we both went out of the house, they begged Babcia and in fact by force carried in a pile of suitcases and beautiful fluffy blankets. I came back from town and “jumped on” Babcia with reproaches. Tulu returned and firmly ordered me to take that baggage back to the Jews. Tulu was convinced that keeping things, and all the more using, taking advantage of them, from Jews so cruelly persecuted, would bring misfortune down on us too. Maybe he was right ?! I returned them and do not regret it. The Jews were taken to the Ghetto – no doubt they perished. It is over-cruel, it is a terrible disgrace for the Germans and the Ukrainians who with all their soul helped to liquidate and persecute the Jews. I remember how the Ghetto burned, how a shootout broke out because the Jews defended themselves. I went about like one demented, my head hurt me without cease. And yet one had to live. I gathered a whole bag of old shoes in order with them to repair three pairs of the most serviceable. Bad luck had it that the cobbler lived opposite the gate of the ghetto. I saw a vehicle driving out of it. It was a truck loaded with Jews. They were jammed together, hunched up because on their backs lay a huge wooden “deka,” and on it sat several Ukrainian militiamen with rifles ready to shoot. Tulu’s apprentice saw with his own eyes how over the common graves—pits there were planks thrown across, on which stood Jews stripped naked, whom the Gestapo men shot. They had machine guns rested on stands; when they got tired of killing they lit a cigarette, had a bite, and then on “to work.” The next day they drove a road roller over the graves covered with lime and earth.
One day, not long after the Germans’ entry, I went and stood in the queue for bread, and because they took me for a Jewess, the Ukrainians began to murmur, to look at me balefully. Fortunately, a neighbor (a Pole) was standing not far off, who since birth had lived in Krzemieniec and therefore was better known than I, and she began to explain that I was a Catholic Pole and not a Jewess. I did not get bread, however, although I presented to the seller a little chain with the Mother of God, and I was witness to a cruel scene. I overheard a clamor and cries coming from the neighboring entryway and saw how a Jew in a caftan with sidelocks leapt out onto the street. Several people ran out after him, but “people” from the queue joined them, who grabbed stones and literally stoned that Jew. The little street was not cobbled, not asphalted. Once I saw how an old Jewess carried on “koromysła” two wooden pails of water; the road went uphill, from which a sleigh approached with the carter standing on it. The peasant deliberately drove over the Jewess, who got under the sleigh, and those sleighs dragged that screaming Jewess along, and the man brandished his whip and did not stop. I too screamed from horror.
Ukrainians
The Poles in the Gubernatorstwo were persecuted by the Germans in a dreadful way, but for us in the so-called Ukraine it was perhaps even worse. In the Gubernatorstwo it was the Germans versus the Poles, and here yet another dreadful enemy joined in: the Ukrainians, and we were a minority. The Ukrainians kept pace with the Germans. It was they who handed us over to the Bolsheviks and then to the Germans. It was They who betrayed to death such truly very valuable people (prof. Opolskiego, Mączaka, Sawojcównę, Torgońskiego, Szynajowiecza i wielu wielu innych). Us, and above all Tula, this awaited as well, but the eastern front began to draw near and so we fled. Prof. Mączak was the founder of the Museum, dr. Opolski wrote, just before the war, a treatise on hitlerism. One hears nothing about Ukrainians staying and perishing in concentration camps.Ania had some severe pains, she cried at times. No wonder if at home there was, for example, only rye flour (Perhaps that is why I do not like rye bread so). So I took Ania in my arms and went to the “Gebitskomisarza” for semolina for Ania. I waited perhaps two hours to be admitted into the presence of the dignitary. I laid out to the Ukrainian interpreter my request, and they chattered among themselves and did not give me even 25 dkg of semolina. The Ukrainians first betrayed us and denounced us to the Bolsheviks — never would so many of us have been deported to Siberia, taken to prisons, shot, if not for the Ukrainians. As soon as the war began the Ukrainians were in contact with the Germans through transmitting stations, they murdered refugees from West. Poland, etc. and so forth.
The death of Julek Unold, of his brothers, the death of thousands of Poles at the hands of the Ukrainians.
Denunciations of Poles, arrests by the Germans and their murdering them went on the whole time. Then the Ukrainians themselves began to murder individual Poles, then whole villages, settlements. On Easter news came from Chodak that Julek Unold had been murdered, that this and that acquaintance had perished in the county, and then a whole avalanche of murdered Poles, entire families with children, the old, whole villages. The Poles defended themselves, fled to larger concentrations—they organized themselves (Read “Czerwone noce” by Cybulski). Many Poles from the nearby villages found themselves in Krzemieniec, whole phalanxes of refugees were already heading for Krzemieniec under the cover of German rifles. For some time I went out every day to the “Wiśniowiecką Rogatkę” and waited with tears for Hela with the children. I saw those poor wretches, some on wagons, others on foot with bundles and children. They slept on boards in the lyceum church, spread out to Polish homes; on the German side there also awaited them the danger of deportation for labor to Germany. The Poles—the inhabitants of Krzemieniec—organized for them and helped as they could. I, with Mrs. Doroszukiewa, also cooked a bucket of soup several times. We chipped in together for it. Mostly it was potatoes with dumplings. The soup was with fat drippings. I went around to the Ukrainian neighbors and straight-out demanded fat. Some gave, like the Skibinieccy, others, like the spiteful Ukrainian woman Turkowa, did not want to give a single slice. When, outraged, shaken, I spoke about it, she said to me: “well, it’s hard, where wood is chopped, chips fly.” “Phalanxes”—whole caravans of Poles were leaving their settlements, until finally in one caravan there was Unoldowa [Maria] with two children—the wife of Jan Unold, cruelly murdered in Szumsk. She lived with us. Right after our escape from Krzemieniec she too managed to escape. She lived in Opole. The children got educated and married. She has already died of cancer. Hela, on the other hand, fled with the children to Ostróg—from there to Bożęcin k/Tarnowa, where at that time two of our brothers, Kazek and Staszek, lived. Of the four Unold brothers only one, Apolinary, was saved by a miracle, and three died. One of them, Florian—a school head k/Kowla—was killed together with his wife Dalka precisely on Easter. The nine-year-old eldest son (Zbyszek) and his two younger brothers (one was an infant) survived. They were taken in by the godparents of one of them from Kowel, but when later they were fleeing from Kowel, the youngest little boy was shot and also died. The eldest—Zbyszek—buried his mother and father by himself, with only a Ukrainian adolescent friend to help. The sołtys was afraid to undertake the burial because it was forbidden to bury “Lachy.” He was afraid to give those children a cart so they could go to Kowel. The son of our landlady was a militiaman. We had a bicycle and he borrowed it almost every day. Tulu from the museum would come and shout at me as to why I had loaned out the bicycle. I would go to them as if to my execution and ask for it back (they lived in the courtyard in an outbuilding). They gave it back to me with a grim face. It was like that a dozen or so times, but we saved the bicycle and sold it just before our flight from Krzemieniec.
One day people began to mill about the yard, speaking Ukrainian among themselves. I ask them what they are doing here, and they say that they fled from Rybcza (village k/Krzemieńca) from the Ukrainians. Astonished, I say that after all they are murdering Poles and not Ukrainians—then I got the answer that they are Poles, but they do not know Polish. The Ukrainians do not ask whether one is from grandfather and great-grandfather on this land, they only murder; they also murder mixed marriages.
Our children during the war
Lilusia lived through those times the most, she was 6 in ’39. She mostly hid in the cellar during the alarms, She with all her might wanted there to be a home and here everything was falling apart. She had enlarged hilar glands [lymph nodes] and I was terribly afraid for Her. In our family three siblings died of tuberculosis, Tula’s brother died of tuberculosis. As soon as I left the house I cried, and here the child is starving. Our neighbor’s husband, Mr. Kruczkowski, was the administrator of a state estate, thus a German one. They were living then in the country in the dwór (in Buchłów), they had everything in abundance. They offered to take Lila to them for a time.
She had solicitous care, splendid fare: dairy, meat, fruit, but for all that, Lila sought secluded places in the park and cried. The doctor who visited them said that she was crying for home. Tulu went by bicycle and had to bring her home. She insisted that for one Easter holiday (those were our last holidays there) the house be whitewashed. I had a broken arm in a cast then, luckily the left one, so with the right hand I whitewashed, washed. Her First Holy Communion took place in the lycée church. She attended preparations very briefly. She had a borrowed little dress, wooden clogs—Tulu made them. The upper was from my white felt hat. I prepared a little wreath, a candle, and let down her beautiful hair, and at that time she had long braids. When the neighbors—Polish women—found out that Lila was going to First Holy Communion, they brought her a veil at the last moment and pinned it on her head themselves. Babcia did not live to see that moment and Lila went alone to church, for I had no one to leave the children with, and I was ashamed to go with the children because I had nothing to dress them in. I did not have much time to see to her education, and Tulu did not know how. When she had almost taught herself to read and write, Tulu would give her his student “textbooks” and make her read aloud. Naturally she later told me herself that she understood nothing of them. In general, throughout the whole duration of the war, as I calculated, Lila attended school all of 15 months. A few months in Zmigrod, a few weeks in Turza, and a few months in Zawada. In N.Sącz she at once went to S of the lycée [i.e., into a high-school grade]. In some subjects she found her way all too well—in others she had not the faintest idea. In his free moments Tulu painted, he also gave Lila paints, cardboard, and I remember her first painting: it was a fir twig in a little vase.Where are you now, my Lilusiu ?!
Otuś was 2 years old at the moment the war broke out. He, like Lila, had had scarlet fever. Lila had enlarged hilar glands [lymph nodes], and Otuś a murmur in his little heart. The child grew and there was nothing to dress him in. I did not know how to sew, and that was simply a misfortune, and in wartime at that; besides, I had no machine. Since childhood I have always liked to embroider. I could not afford a seamstress during the war, a hairdresser was out of the question too, so I cut Otuś’s hair myself “à la garnek” [a bowl cut]. Some little shirts and blouses I cobbled together by hand myself, but it looked “pożal się Boże.” Oluś was often ill. In Krzemieniec he got pneumonia, and here there was neither a doctor nor medicines. We had acquaintances who worked in the German military hospital, and from them we got some pills, only I do not remember which—I did cupping, and somehow it helped him as well as Lila. Education consisted above all of stacks of prewar “Płomyczek” magazines and Babcia’s tales, and from time to time of my reading children’s little books. I liked to sing to the children, and I still marvel at myself how I could do that in such macabre times. Part of the children’s education were also Tulu’s bicycle outings with Otuś and Lila in turns. They rode through the forests, they rode to the [Ikwę] until the Ukrainians began to murder, for then one could no longer even “stick one’s nose” out of town. I taught Otuś to read and write in his sixth year, during regular lessons with Bogna, Nusia’s daughter. This was already after our escape from Krzemieniec. From his earliest years Otuś made little plans [sketch maps] and liked to look at geographical atlases. I remember how, after having my arm set, I was returning from the hospital after a night spent there. I was returning anxious and at the same time happy to the children, and from afar I saw Ania and Otuś standing on the little veranda. When I began calling to them, the children then disappeared into my little barrel, which stood on the small balcony. They (the children) thought I had been completely deprived of one arm and therefore hid. Anusia, as they say, was born under the drums. As long as she was an infant there was no trouble, for the pram, the little pillow, the shirts she had from Otuś; but the older she was, the worse it became. Her first little dress was remade from a wall hanging of gray linen, but the little dress was sewn by a seamstress; I only embroidered stars on it. She later had more little dresses, but this one I remember the most. Babcia delighted in her wise big eyes, but she remembers Babcia little, for she was barely 2 when Babcia died. Often up to a year and a half she cried, evidently she had some pains, but no wonder, sometimes from rye and [zuręta] they perish. Naturally, she had no toys. When she was 3–4 years old I told her how Oluś and Lila, before the war, would throw bananas and oranges under the bed—Ania asked what the appearance and taste of those fruits were like. I remember how once I got hold of bolted flour, and Ania did not want to eat dumplings made from it, saying that she did not want such sticky dumplings. In Zmigrod near Jasło she was probably something like 4 years old already, and although she was truly an exceptionally smart little girl, she could not pronounce “r”. Mr. Kahl—the dairy employee—was terribly delighted and paid her for saying a little poem,
Black cow, in bujgundy dots
Devoujed the gjass, tunjing its mug
Dajn it, how did so many “j”s get in heje.
The Zmigrod period was a separate stage for the whole family. I tried to send Ania to the nuns (in Zmigrod) who ran something like a kindergarten. I gave Her a bottle of milk, a slice of bread with butter (in Żmigrodzie Tulu worked at the dairy which was run by Nusia), but Ania did not want to play with the other children and stopped going. The children played best together as a foursome: Ania, Otuś, Bogna, and Kazek Unold (I took Him to us from Hela, who at that time was teaching in Lezach k/Borzęcina). Lila did not take part in these games. Sometimes the children went wild and Ania presided over it and always in these games showed the greatest courage. I remember when Mrs. Kruczkowska came to us (she too had fled from Krzemieniec and lived near Jasło). Nusia, I and Mrs. Kruczkowska could not talk ourselves out — the younger children were playing and Lila disappeared; after a while I found Her behind the curtain in a corner (that hiding place behind the wardrobe served us), she sat hunched and cried .... because she could not stand that bustle, the loud conversation. Our children were a little strange. I must return to Otuś who fell ill with pneumonia again. Aunt Nusia had gone somewhere, I cooked dinners at Her place for two households, I looked after Julek, Nusia’s husband, who was ill with tuberculosis. It was very hard for me to look after a bunch of children and two sick people. There was an acquaintance doctor, Dr. Rezacz (he was murdered by the Gestapo because he tended to wounded ‘Akowcy’ [AK members]) and he prescribed and gave us prontosil and only aspirin. It seems that aspirin and cupping helped best. I must still write about the further “education” of the children, especially Ania. When fate cast us as far as Zawadzie K/N.Sącza we lived there with our relatives the Zarębów. Wishing to repay them I undertook to teach their two children, Józkę and Hanię, to read and write. Besides that I took on for lessons two more of the neighbors’ children. Ania staunchly kept pace with me in these lessons although I basically did not teach Her because then she was probably not quite 5 years old, and those children were already 7. I had to buy Her notebooks, and Otuś and Lila would “assign” to Her. In a short time Ania was already reading newspapers, and those children were still “spelling out” from the primer.
I return again to the Krzemieniec times, to the breaking of my arm. It would be a trifle in normal times but in wartime it is a small Tragedy. I obtained for a piece of soap 2 liters of buckwheat, but unmilled. It was early spring when I went with it to the hand-mill at some acquaintances. I ground the buckwheat, an acquaintance woman sifted out the husks for me and besides that let me have 2l. of milk. Immensely pleased with this I was hurrying back to get home before dusk, and a stretch of the road led through the forest. I was going downhill and my nose in the ground covered with ice [looking down at the ice-covered ground]. I braced myself on my hand and it “snapped” on me. I made it down to the main road, but I did not go into the house, I only passed in through the children the backpack with the milk and flour and summoned Tulu, who was having lessons with pupils working through the high-school classes. Tulu led me to the hospital. The arm swelled and at the hospital they wanted to cut the sleeve of the fur coat - my only warm covering. I did not allow it — with difficulty they took that fur off me and set the arm under anesthesia. The fracture was complicated and with displacement but everything knit well and to this day I feel no pains in that arm. I wore the arm in a cast for 6 weeks and that was a horror because I could neither comb the children nor myself, and I also wore two braids above my ears which I tucked under and that was my hairstyle. Tulu combed us but v. unskillfully. Babcia was no longer alive then.
Christmas trees
I suppose in those hard times I was very resourceful and I tried somehow to keep that "home" going, and for every holiday there was a Christmas tree. One holiday during the German occupation there was an announcement that under no circumstances was it permitted to have a Christmas tree, and it was already a horror to bring one from the forest yourself. Two stubborn creatures, Gena Mojkowa and Gena Duda, went to the nearest German estate. In the park fence they found a hole and cut down two beautiful Christmas trees in the park. It was already late at night when each of us brought the children a Christmas tree. The underground press was a great joy for us. Often those little papers were already barely holding together at the folds; after reading, we passed them on to a neighbor, naturally only a Polish woman. Various prophecies were copied out and they heartened us greatly — "hope is the mother of fools". We still have them — perhaps I'll manage it and copy them out for the children. Oh how we waited for the end of the war. My dearest dreams were, in my mind, to greet Polish soldiers, and deep down I was sure of this, while I considered the marching Germans as defeated from the start.
Somehow I managed to establish contact with Nusia, who was then in Zmigrod. It was by a whole heaven better for her than for us, but she could not really come to our aid, for from the General Government one could send parcels of barely 25 dkg. Nusia sent me 2 times a little parcel with new stockings. Naturally I sold them at once, and with that money I bought an iron stove with one "fajerka" [burner], it helped us a great deal because I set it up in the room and so it heated us at the same time and I could cook on it. I would have forgotten to write about one important thing. They gave us from the Muzeum Słowackiego for safekeeping the manuscript of Balladyna. Słowacki's handwriting was like little pearls, even, clear, on splendid paper. Besides, there were also poems there, such as, for example, "Smutno mi Boże", which Słowacki illustrated with pen-and-ink. It is plain that he was in every sense of the word an artist. I did not know where to keep this treasure. Among the books I was afraid that in case of a search they would find this manuscript, and yet by hiding it under the mattresses I exposed it just the same. I wrapped it in linen cloth and from time to time I looked through it. The only thing the Germans did not liquidate was the Muzeum Słowackiego located in the manor house in which Słowacki was born. (At present the Soviet authorities have made a library in that little house, and the exhibits in the form of furniture they have put up in the attic above the general museum. In this museum there is only a small hall with two display cases in which there are some keepsakes of Słowacki.) The curator under the Germans was Dr. Kryński; he was a cripple but a very educated man; he had a young and pretty wife. I was in that museum several times and I liked it there enormously, the quiet, the perfect order, By the little house apple trees grew, we received apples from them. We were three years ago in Krzemieniec and we visited everything. It is clearly visible that they are destroying all mementos and traces of Polishness. If I am already on cultural matters, I must still mention the fate of the enormous library which was at the Liceum im. T. Czackiego. It contained all the new publications and besides that the so-called black and white ravens of our literature. When the Bolsheviks entered Krzemieniec — Tulu was working in the Muzeum (he was head of the natural history department) so he had access to the lyceum buildings. One time he came and, as the saying goes, almost cried to me, because he had seen how the Bolsheviks had lit a bonfire in the courtyard and were burning and tearing beautiful books. Tulu secretly brought a few books, but when we fled from Krzemieniec it all was lost. One fellow saved Słowacki's manuscript (I did not remember his surname), who managed to make his way to Warsaw. All trace of the manuscript was lost. If it had remained with us it would have been saved.
Further about the Muzeum. Before the war Tulu simply staked his life on collecting (now he continues to do so). As a little boy he began with matchboxes. Then he collected books, chemicals, plants and insects (now stamps, newspapers, and, well, books). He collected insects with great expertise and passion. The display cases a carpenter made for him at our expense. The insects had their antennae and legs arranged to tenths of a millimeter; the larger insects were prepared, and, for example, caterpillars were inflated. At night we both hunted Moths. Every walk was joined either with catching insects or with gathering plants. Even little Lila paid attention to insects, which she called "eku". I sometimes looked askance at it, because we were not rolling in it and the display cases cost a lot. There were 32 of those cases. At the moment the war broke out, Tulu consolidated those cases in the house. One room was entirely hung with them. In each case there was a little ampoule with a moth-killing agent. The cases are very tight. When we fled from Krzemieniec Tulu gave those cases to the Muzeum "for safekeeping" and there they have remained to this day. When we were with Tulu three years ago we saw them — they are beautifully preserved. Tulu now intended to open them, but I dissuaded him for fear that precisely upon opening bacteria might get in and destroy the insects. These are priceless collections. The whole satisfaction is that the present employees treated Tulu with great respect and spread the word about arranging a great exhibition of insects with a portrait of Tulu. Apart from those cases there are also in the museum plants collected by Tulu. There are something about 2 thousand. The present employees write to us and asked Tulu who was the founder of the Muzeum, naturally it was Prof. Mączak, murdered by the Germans, and not Mr. Cynkałowski, who puts himself forward as the founder.
I wept my fill during the stay in Krzemieniec. I like Krzemieniec very much. Two of our children were born there, there is Babcia's grave there. Lili was born in Żołkiew, which is now rechristened "Niesterow". Everyone there received us as guests, even Mrs. Turkowa, a rabid Ukrainian, gave us a jar of honey, but what of it when everyone is waiting for the Germans. For me all this produced the impression as if I were staying in a grave. At moments it seemed to me that I could smell the stench of corpses, And everywhere dirty, ugly. Our relatives live in old, musty houses. The old Brody is one ruin, the roads rutted, holes, mud, dust. The trees cut down. Of Babcia's little house not a trace. In general people there build very little, and those new buildings are such cobbled-together little houses, without fences. The shops, dirty, wretched. People very badly dressed. Women neglected, obese. The trees cut down. Kremieniec is, comparatively, on the outside little damaged and clean, for it owes that to scholarly congresses. The cemeteries overgrown — drowning in nettles, the plaques torn from Polish graves. There are no Greek-Catholic churches, There are only Orthodox churches, only old women go to them. Those working, nor the youth, are not allowed to go to church. The Catholic church in Brody has been turned into a school of phys. education. The lyceum church in Krzemieniec boarded up with planks. The Catholic parish church is open once a month. The monastery in Podkamień has been turned into a home for the insane. In Podkamień on the roads lie beautiful statues of saints knocked down. The buses dirty, rickety. The eateries vile. In the shops something of value can be had only for a bribe. I did not believe Tulu when he told about grain drying on the highways, until I saw it myself with my own eyes. Everyone drinks vodka. Divorces on the order of the day. I know that the present government on those lands does not care, but if the Ukrainians were more cultured it would not be so. I do not want to go there anymore. Something draws Tulu there but let him go alone.
Our escape from Krzemieniec.
At the “farm” we left Unoldowa Maria. She too soon after us fled and the farm was taken over by Gena Majkowa. What happened to the furniture—I do not know, and there was quite a lot of it, for three rooms were furnished. Part of the bedding, dishes and books we loaded into crates and trunks and left with neighbors “for safekeeping.” We had to flee—around Krzemieniec the Ukrainian rabble. In Krzemieniec the raging Germans. Tulu’s Polish co-workers were being hunted out like peas by the Germans. Any day Tulu might not come home from the museum. The children had long been asking me for a kitten. Downstairs in the basement flats lived a woman. Her cat had lovely kittens. I got one—a beautiful gray one. We named him Szaruś. The children did not want to leave the kitten in Krzemieniec and took him with them. Everyone later spoke about the cat fleeing with us. Beforehand we gathered information, addresses needed during the flight. We had very little cash, since the Ukrainians did not want to buy, as they knew anyway that we would not take our belongings with us; besides, those hyenas had enough off the Jews. We took with us the remains of our clothing, some bedding. Tulu took along a lot of his junk, like a microscope, some special mirror, tweezers, and the like. Now Tulu says he took that unnecessarily, but then it was hard for him to part with it. The most important things were documents and photographs. I took the kettle my mother bought me when I went to a post and which still serves us to this day. We hired a wagon, loaded our “estate.” The children too got on it with the kitten and a toy monkey, we with Tulu went on foot into the unknown, the terrible. We did not receive permission to leave, but at the railway station we got on the train “without paying.” In the same compartment sat some Germans, but they pretended not to see us. Thus we reached Dubno. We hauled out our bundles and set up camp in the waiting room. Supposedly some railwayman there was to place us in a train bound for Brody, where Tulu’s brother—Aldek—working on the railway at that time, awaited us, but here one train after another departed and we sat at the station. Tulu fainted. When I revived Him, we put our heads together and Tulu went to the railwaymen and showed them a gold five-rouble—it helped. They shoved us into a train, but what of it when in Radziwiłłów they told us to get off. It was the border station between the so-called Ukraine and the Gubernatorstwo. The next station was already Brody and in it Aldek. The station was empty and we alone with a heap of bundles and the children in the middle. A Polish railwayman came up to us and advised us to leave the platform quickly, for when the shift came on, and those were Ukrainians, we would be done for. We dragged as best we could the bundles and children to the nearest house. We were lucky, for it was the house of a Polish railwayman. He installed us in a room from which on that very day they had carried to the cemetery the remains of that railwayman’s son, murdered by the Ukrainians. Late in the afternoon a railwayman from Brody appeared who took Lila and Otuś into a freight train to a railwaymen’s hut. He locked them in and I was terribly afraid of that separation. The children arrived safely; Aldek took Them, who supposedly wept when he saw them. We were left alone with Ania in Radziwiłłów because our hosts were not there. Suddenly toward evening we heard gunfire, and very close. We lay down on the ground under the windows and waited. Suddenly someone began pounding at the windows, we were terribly frightened because we thought they were bandits, until we heard a voice: panie Duda—please open. That young, tall railwayman had come especially for us. He snatched Ania into his arms and we only the suitcase with documents and photographs and we ran after him to the locomotive waiting for us. On the tracks a German stopped us for a moment, but that railwayman replied energetically that he was rescuing us from bandits, and thus we reached the engine. They came on purpose for us, supposedly that railwayman ferried many families into the Gubernatorstwo for evacuation and himself was killed. We got off at night before the station and went to the agreed-upon house to sleep. In the morning we went to the Aldeks, where Lila and Oluś were already waiting for us. Supposedly safe yet poor, homeless, helpless. All our belongings remained in Radziwiłłów and only later that railwayman, moving to Brody, conveyed also our “treasures.” We obtained for a fee “fake” kenkarty (equivalents of an identity card), and waited for Nusia, who was to come for us from Zmigrod. When Nusia saw us she was disappointed, for she thought that after all the family of a professor would arrive, and here we with Tulu were thin, blackened, dressed “God help us,” and three wretched children. We walked for the last time in the garden at old Brody, we slept under Tulu’s family roof. In that little house during the holidays Otuś was baptized. To that little house I used to come in my maiden days and later as a married woman, in that little house Lila stayed for some time under Babcia’s care. In that little house Ania was for the first and last time. We ate fruit from the trees that Tulu had planted. The little house was charming. It had a little porch overgrown with vine, a vestibule from which one entered a room and a little kitchen on the right, and on the left there were two tiny rooms, those little rooms separated by a thin wall not reaching the ceiling. Wooden floors, clean and yellow, white walls. In the garden lilacs, acacias, ashes, fruit trees and many flowers. We had to say farewell to the Aldeks (they had then three sons), to the little house, and go further—to Zmigrod K/Jasła. The road was awful. In Lwów in Podzamcze we waited long and to the train there came the stench of burning bodies. In the train an incredible crush, the children stood the whole time on benches behind people’s backs. In their arms they held the kitten, who kept struggling to get away. With difficulty we reached Jasło and from there by some lorry to Zmigrod. Auntie’s little flat—clean, cozy, peaceful, but unfortunately Julek—Nusia’s husband—was already then ill with tuberculosis. Tuberculosis had already taken over his whole organism, he could no longer walk for his legs were also diseased. At Nusia’s then stayed Julek’s sister Zosia Mrożkowa—the mother of the writer Mrożek, later known. I remember that for supper then there were potato dumplings. I do not remember after how many days, probably right the next day, we moved to “our own.” It was one room in a former Jewish house. Besides us there lived there two other families, the Przewłockis and the Brożynas. They had two-room flats. Brożynowa came from Zmigrod and they even had a bit of their own field. The Przewłockis were refugees. Mrs. Przewłocka worked at the dairy. Przewłocki wrote poems. The Brożynas had a little daughter Halinka, and the Przewłockis a little ward Janeczka, sickly and very inappropriately clothed and brought up; during the front that child died. Tulu also worked at the dairy and at that time it was a food paradise. There was plenty of milk, we got cream and butter, there was bread and even meat. Nusia gave us some cloth from which I sewed coats for Ania and Lila, I even kitted out Otuś and even Kazik Unold (he was also with us) from old clothes. I too sewed myself as many as two dresses. In a word, a paradise compared to Krzemieniec. I remember my first trip to the seamstress, who lived beyond Zmigrod. I had to force myself to that walk because in Krzemieniec it was impossible because of the Ukrainian bands. Just before the flight from Krzemieniec we slept with axes under the beds, so as to defend ourselves in case of an attack. Not far from us they had already murdered our acquaintance Górecki. Our “furniture” in Zmigrod was mostly knocked together by Tulu from sawmill offcuts. There were two “couches” and a cupboard made of boards, and Nusia lent us 1 iron bed, a table, a small cupboard and a few chairs. It was not much bigger, perhaps the same as our present room. One couch was carried into the entry hall by day. Kazik U. slept on it. He was to be at Nusia’s, but I took him to us because the sick Jurek needed peace and Kazek was terribly talkative; secondly, I did not want the starved, emaciated boy to be in contact with a consumptive. On the shelves, as usual where Tulu is, there already lay little stacks of newspapers. We burned a lamp. In the evenings we sat at the table, the cat strolled under our chins or on our shoulders. I, as usual, did not idle, I often cooked dinners at Nusia’s, helped her wash and clean, at our place too one had to scrub the floor, cook, and so on. I taught Bogna and Otuś, and Lila even had a few piano lessons and went to school. I also went to Jasło with butter for the Germans; on that occasion I always took something to trade, most often veal, cream, butter (that was Nusia’s goods), but also for us I took so much that for that goods the dentist repaired the teeth for me and Lila. Those were dangerous trips, for often at the entrance to Jasło the Germans searched us. For that purpose I took Lila and under the seat I hid the goods; in the back there were crates of butter for the warehouse. Nusia always awaited our return with fear. Tulu often took the children for walks—they gathered ćereń, from which I made excellent juice. Otuś again fell ill with pneumonia but, as usual, came out of it safely. The torment was Julek’s illness. Nusia, as they say, “stood on her head” to save him, but inexorable tuberculosis devoured Him. He was a very handsome fellow, he was a teacher, but even before the war Father pulled Him into the dairy (it was their own). When the war broke out, Nusia with Julek took over the post in Zmigrod and Julek’s parents remained in Bożęcin. Kazik U. was in Zmigrod until First Communion, and he was Lila’s contemporary. That idyll did not last long—from the east the front was approaching. The Germans had fits of fury. The Armia Krajowa (A-K) had its hands full. Almost the entire intelligentsia of Zmigrod belonged to the AK. By day they worked, by night they went on actions, and here already the Germans ordered trenches to be dug. I, on account of small children, was exempted from this. Tulu, as a worker of the dairy, too. Some traitor betrayed the AK men. Gestapo men made a dragnet for them. The front was already close—a “theater” was coming to Zmigrod, the “artistes” lodged in private homes. One of them lodged with the Brożynas, who belonged to the AK. As a precaution he carved out some earth under the floor so as to hide in case of a search. The night was sultry, we were sleeping with the window open. Suddenly I hear: “Das Fenster zumachen, aber schnell.” I shut the window and the Gestapo were already banging on the entry door. Przewłocki opened to them and the Germans straight to us. They shone their torches, saw Tulu in bed and say “Gut, gut der Mann ist zu Hause” and pulled out a list of the condemned. They asked for Tulu’s surname, which, however, did not figure in their list. They made a search anyway and told Tulu to get dressed and took him to the Brożynas. Hearing the racket at our place and in the entry, Brożyna instantly jumped into the little pit that was in the corner of the kitchen. In that spot stood a table covered with a cloth. The Germans slapped the “artiste” across the face for not keeping an eye on Brożyna, they simply raged. They ordered Tulu and Przewłocki to shovel a bit of coal in the cellar. They poked with bayonets every sheaf of straw in the attic. Brożyna vanished and the house had already been under observation since dusk. They took Tulu and Przewłocki and ordered them to lead the way to the indicated addresses. Tulu knew whom they meant but luckily wriggled out of it, saying he was a stranger, that he knew no one, and led them to such a house as was not on the list. They beat Tulu and told him to go home; Tulu came drenched in sweat, for until the last moment he was sure they would kill him. My reaction was an unceasing shriek. The Germans leapt at me and hushed me like a witch, and I surely looked like one, for I was in a black combination and had tousled hair. The next day they told me that with that screaming I alarmed the neighboring houses and the suspects ran away. When they took Tulu I was already certain I would never see Him again. The Germans took Brożynowa and said that if her husband did not report by morning they would kill Her. Tulu and Przewłocki were gone—I remained alone with the children and little Halinka Brożynówna. The Germans ordered the light to be left on and every so often they burst into the house together with the “artiste.” Little Halinka had a cradle fastened to the floor—I had to sit by Her and rock her. After some time I heard from the little pit in the kitchen the voice of Brożyna, who asked me to hand him clothing, for he was in only a shirt. Brożyna’s clothes lay in the kitchen, but I handed him another from the wardrobe. Toward morning Tulu came—an enormous relief. I told Him about Brożyna. In the morning a lamenting family burst in and took Halinka, but about Brożyna I told them nothing. Only when the guard from under the house had left did I pass him breakfast under the table and some cigarettes, and Brożyna fled through the gardens to the forest. Brożynowa and several other female hostages were assigned to a front-line kitchen—after some time they began to importune the soldiers and well, they all returned home. Then there was the attempt on Hitler. German troops marched through Zmigród—I stood in the doorway and the soldiers waved their hands at me and shouted, “Matka! das Krüg ist cu ende.” Unfortunately for us, that was when the “Krüg” was only beginning. During that raid they took several people from Zmigrod and shot them. The front was drawing near—when the houses already began to shake from explosions, then we did the biggest foolishness with Nusia. We took the most valuable things, the sick Julek and the children, and went to Kąty (closer to the Przełęcz Dukielska) right on the Wisłoka, in the hope that the front would pass us by, and here it was quite the opposite.
Angles
We arrived on a beautiful September day in Kąty. Sun, fruit on the trees. We set up our “camp” at an acquaintance’s farm—Wokurka’s, in a new house at the foot of the hill. Aunt Nusia drove us and turned back to Zmigrod to rescue and secure property. Meanwhile the front drew near in a moment and took Kąty into its range. Some of the inhabitants, together with their cattle, took refuge in the forests, some in the vaulted cellars. We spread kilims on the floor and lay on it “flat as a pancake”: the ailing Julek, his daughter, Six-year-old Bogna, Tulu, I, Lila, Otuś, and Ania. Our hosts fled to the woods. The house quivers from the explosion of bullets, plaster falls from the walls and dusts us over, the room is white from it. “Out of nowhere” the first Soviet soldier walks into the house, opens a window and sets up a machine gun in it and fires. I beg him to leave this house because there are children here and a gravely ill man. It did not help. He advised us to leave the house, but how—Julek was on crutches, little children, and out in the open bullets were whistling thickly. Where to go?! To the woods too far, to some cellar we do not know how far. (The cellars were separate, almost entirely dug into the ground, only the round roofs stuck up above the earth). With a heavy heart we leave Julek (at his insistent request), the children put on their little coats, we gathered only the suitcase with documents and literally, between bullets, we creep, we run, wanting to reach some cellar, We ran into, I think, [into] a large one and no one took us in. Under the little roof of one cellar stood a peasant, who magnanimously advised us to shelter by the undercut of trees by the Wisłoka. Indeed, tall trees grow by the Wisłoka, we scramble down the steep bank and nestle into the hollow under the roots. Above us the Bolsheviks, on the opposite bank of the Wisłoka the Germans. Battle! Bullets splash right at our feet as they fall into the water. At a certain moment, from beyond the corner of a house on the other side of the Wisłoka, the figure of a German emerges with a rifle ready to fire. I went numb because he was aiming in our direction. Maybe he cottoned on that these were civilians with children—we remained alive. We sat under that undercut almost until dusk. In the meantime Tulu “visited” Julek twice. Although the house was left without windowpanes, Julek nonetheless survived. Toward evening we made it to acquaintances’ cellar. It was tiny, along one wall stood chests with the hosts’ clothing and bedding. We lined the free half with kilims. Two thirds of the little cellar was a single bed on which sometimes 13–14 people slept in a row. Aside from the little children no one could straighten their legs. Poor, tall, sick Julek! The little cellar, especially at night, shook to its foundations, right past the door heavy tanks rumbled. If a grenade had hit the roof we would all have been buried. In the morning it was quieter. Then we would come out of the little cellar. The two of us, with Nusia, combed and washed the children. We cooked in the cottage, on the sly, in haste, we scraped potatoes and even ground grain on the quern. We had fat in the form of rendered butter. Right before the offensive I bought a little piglet, naturally it stayed in Zmigrod, but our acquaintance Jan Nowak (he is a judge now), killed it and brought us half to Kąty. We cooked “ein Topf” and only Julek ate separately, the rest from a single pot. Kąty again passed into German hands. All over the village plenty of soldiers’ corpses were lying about. Tulu had to bury them. In the neighboring house there was the so-called “Szreibsztuba”. The Germans drove the civilians they caught to build a bridge that Soviet planes were bombing. Tulu was driven there several times. The Germans were grabbing chickens all over Kąty, which they ordered me and Nusia to pluck. Once I started griping, calling the Germans Szwaby and the like. One of them, who was dozing with his back against the table in the kitchen, understood Polish; he sprang at me with a revolver—I bolted for the cellar—the German after me—only then did Tulu block his way and begin to excuse me—it worked, for the German waved his hand and went away. Among the Germans milling about, there were also cultured ones, even with a heart. Did I not exaggerate with that “heart”? But a fact is a fact—one of those Germans almost every day took Ania in his arms, carried her to the storehouse-truck, and piled on for her either sugar or some sort of canned goods. The front dragged on; for us these were ages. We decided to get out of Kąty. But how? To the point from which one might leave the front by military vehicle—it was far, especially for the sick and limping Julek, and on top of that little children and a few odds and ends, Nusia learned that the German on whom our fate depended was celebrating his name day or birthday. She gathered some autumn flowers from neighboring gardens and went to offer congratulations. She returned with a promise that they would take us out of Kąty, only we had to get to the point on our own. On foot it was impossible, for Julek was lame, little children, bundles. Some means of transport depended on the commander of the “szreibsztube”. It was I who was to manage to get that cart. I went to the German and he set about making amorous advances—luckily a front-line soldier came to report, and that saved me. We got the cart. We loaded it with our belongings, seated the ailing Julek and little Anusia on it, Lila, Oluś, and Bogna clung to the back of the cart and rode standing. We had not gone far when the Soviets began to rake the road with hurricane fire. It was hell. We snatched up Ania, helped Julek down in a flash, and took shelter in the nearest cellar. Meanwhile our carter drove the horses with our belongings to the place where the autos departed. Again a horrible problem—how to get there with the sick Julek and the little children. Not far off there was an improvised dressing station. We went there with Nusia. The chief doctor—furious—was living essentially on black coffee and cigarettes, because he was performing amputations for wounded Germans without a break. Somehow we prevailed upon someone from the auxiliary staff and they gave us an ambulance with which Julek arrived. The children and we went on foot. Our things were piled in an empty barn—again an attack. Lila and Otuś were then in the barn, and tiles from it were pouring down onto the yard. Naturally we came out of that, too, unscathed, But to thoroughly overwhelm us a pouring rain set in, mud up to the ankles, and through this mud we carried our bundles to the truck waiting for us. As the children scrambled under the truck’s canvas cover, literally a puddle formed around each of them. None of the children, nor even we, so much as sneezed. At last we drove beyond the front line—to the point that one felt stupid in that silence. They brought us late at night to some locality and we found ourselves in an empty room with straw and hay on the floor. The Germans who sat in the further rooms gave us hot black coffee and we lay down to sleep in a row. In the morning we set out further on our way. The driver was a bit under the influence and wanted to deliver us right to the house in Turzy K/Gorlic. In that house lived Julek’s brother, a teacher in Turza. Already just before the very destination, the ride might have ended tragically. The road was slippery, clayey, led uphill, and on the left and right sides a steep drop, the so-called “paryje”. The car was just above the precipice when Ania raised a terrible scream and the unfortunate driver stopped the motor. We got out carefully so that the car would not overturn and, partly on foot, partly on the cart brought by Kazik Kędzior, we reached our destination. Nusia with Julek and Bogna settled into a tiny little room at Kazik’s, and we, not far away, with a widow.
Stay in Turza.
Auntie Nusia did what she could to procure food and nursed her sick husband. We were healthy, but each day was very hard to get through. I bartered the remnants of rags for food, I went to dig potatoes, Tulu went to the forest for fuel. Digging was hard work for me. The peasants gathered and in turn conducted the digging. They were sated and strong compared to me, and I wanted to come through with honor and kept up with them as best I could. For daily work I received two meals and a basket of potatoes. The women saw it was hard for me and afterwards would leave me in the kitchen, where I cooked a substantial supper for on average 15–20 people. Our landlady, along with her sons, was lousy; the lice did not spare us either. The village was relatively rich and, despite the quotas, people did not go hungry. Lila began to go to school in Turza. When the teacher asked the children what each had eaten for breakfast—Lila said “dziama,” because that was what the mixture was called there. All the children laughed at Lila. We had no help from anywhere. I felt I would not endure long in Turza. One day I went to Sącz on reconnaissance. I rode a freight train in the little cabin with a railwayman, and again there were amorous advances, which I wriggled out of with difficulty. It was probably after some 10–12 years that I then came to Sącz. Weeping and laughing by turns, I walked the streets. I went to our “street.” “Our” house was standing. I went in to strangers, into “our” apartment. It was something like a “Fata Morgana” in the desert. An elusive mirage. Then I went to Zawadę K/N.Sącza, where to this day live my Father’s relatives: the Zarębas and the Kumors told us they would take us in. I do not remember how I got from N.Sącza to Gorlice, from where I walked to Turza (about 10 km). After arriving in Turza I went to the sołtys to ask for a furmanka. He did not. They explained that if we did not leave, they would have to support us, because we already had nothing, and from hunger and cold we probably would not die. He did not, and yet most of the peasants—and Turza is a big village—owned horses. The sołtys magnanimously advised us to go along with the Germans who would come here for hay. We had no other way out, and at the appointed time we drove up in our landlady’s furmanka (the furmanka was pulled by cows) to the sołtys’s house. We were there around 11 and left already after dark. At the sołtys’s there was the smell of fried scrambled eggs, there was bread and milk on the table, and we set off on dry bread. The Germans loaded two furmankas with hay “up to the ceiling.” On the bottom of one they put our odds and ends (a kilim, a little bedding, photographs, documents, and the remains of clothing). On the [other] we barely “wystyrmali” ourselves [clambered up] and, swaying, set off on the road. The Germans, probably by order, sang the Polish anthem almost the whole way, naturally mangling it badly—they were losing, and so they became “Polish patriots.” We arrived at Gorlice around midnight. The Germans unloaded the hay somewhere else, and there our “estate” also remained. We stayed with the Germans at quarters. They treated us to hot coffee and bread. In the morning we began looking around for a means of locomotion—to Sącz. The railway fell through, as we did not get a pass. We stood a long time on the road until one German agreed to go for the children and our things and take us back to N.Sącz. We had remnants of vodka and bacon and promised that to the driver. We arrived in Sącz—got off at the market—the German looked at us and did not take payment. I went to Mrs. Doroszukowa at 3 Różana Street. Unfortunately she was not at home, the children, locked in, were peering out the window onto the balcony. While waiting for Mrs. Doroszukowa we went down to the cobbler who had his workshop on the ground floor. Worn out to the last limits, I told him a few bitter truths about some Poles. That great patriot took offense and did not even offer us water. Mrs. Doroszukowa arrived, fed us “with whatever the cottage was rich in,” and at her place there was misery. We slept one night and in the morning I went to Zawada, Whence I came by furmanka and took the family to the relatives.
Zawada.
We first lived with the Kumors. It was a childless couple. They were raising Mietek Fręczek, whose mother—the sister of Kumorowa—died when Mietek was still a little boy. Kumorowa is a Zarębianka by birth—the daughter of my Father's sister. Kumor is an old, conceited man. He treated us like intruders - who disturbed his peace. They had three rooms, they gave us the smallest little room right next to the kitchen, without a stove. At first we ate together, the fare was very simple, but that was a trifle, everything tasted good to us. It was worse that Kumor wanted to get rid of us.Po On the opposite side of the road lived Józef and Maria Zarębowie. Józef is also the son of my Father’s sister. They had as many as 9 children. They were relatively well-off because they had 25 morgs of land and a piece of forest, but they were terribly ravaged by the war. However, they were much more cordial and than Kumor who moreover was the wójt and could really help us. The Zarębowie whitewashed a room for us, lent two beds, a trestle table, a bench and two folding chairs, and once again we had our own “home”.I tried to get food as much as possible on my own - Kumor looked down on us. He did not believe that Tulu was a prof. at the Krzemieniec Lyceum, and I a teacher. One time I baked cookies with saccharin, made tea, and invited Kumor. On the occasion I showed him our diplomas, the youngest, five-year-old Ania, performed reading the newspaper for him, and we did impress Mr. wójt a little. He arranged a bigger ration of flour for us, and wooden clogs for Tulu. Kumorowa gave us 1 l. of wonderful milk (for 5 people). I went for potatoes to the cellars as if to my own. The Christmas holidays were splendid because there was plenty of bread, there was even a roll, a bit of meat in the form of a chicken I had earned. The Christmas tree dressed with sugar cubes in paper wrappers. I was at the name day of another Zarębianka, Ludmiła; that was also a childless marriage, also “oakish” but I ate my fill there of sausage, cake and got tipsy on samogon. To repay the Zarębowie, the kindest of all those relatives, I taught two of their children, Hanka and Józek, to write and read (now Hanka has finished a tailoring vocational school, married, has a handsome house and 3 children. Józek is preparing for his master’s exam in extramural studies). On the occasion of teaching the Zarębowie, two of the neighbors’ children also came to lessons, and Ania learned too. All this lasted not quite 3 months, because in January 1945 (exactly on January 20). Just a few days before, some German unit arrived at Zawada, which carried over to the Kumors a whole, slaughtered piglet. They didn’t manage to eat it, they had to flee. Kumorowa called me so that I would “dress” it. For the first time in my life I took on such a job. I took Tulu’s razor and shaved the piglet with it and then they helped me split it. I got an entire half from the Kumors. I gave a quarter to the Zarębas and a quarter remained for us. It was a splendid feast. Night came, again bullets Through the yard whistled like swallows.I had to go to the well for water, and literally right by my ear a bullet whizzed past. We crammed ourselves into the cellar with the Zarębas, but we sat in it only one night. I couldn’t sit still and kept going out of the cellar and observing the battle. Zawada on the height. Below N.Sącz, the sky was dark-navy, densely lit by shells. One terrible incubus - the Germans, went away. In the morning Bolshevik units entered Zawada. At the Zarębas’ and the Kumors’ there were swarms of them. They stole literally from under one’s hands, they raped women. I, by virtue of commanding the Ukrainian language, often had to intervene in various matters among the neighbors. At the Kumors’ the captain himself took up residence, of which Kumor was extremely proud. They gave him the best room in which stood a chest of drawers, and in it, locked in a drawer, two gold wedding rings, a gold chain and a large gold pocket watch. The “Pan” captain had to go on to Berlin, but before that he pried up the top of the chest and took “as a keepsake” all the gold. There was a countless number of such various theft incidents. During the military operations the beautiful Sącz castle was blown up. The castle was blown up by order of the Bolshevik troops, quite unnecessarily. In my youth various ceremonies took place in the castle courtyard. In the halls exhibitions were arranged of paintings by such painters as Reguły, or the excellent portraitist Barbacki (he was killed at the hands of the Germans as a hostage). In the grove surrounding the castle I picked honey mushrooms and russulas. The bridge over the Dunajec was blown up by the Germans. The end of the bridge along which I walked with my dad as a child and later with girlfriends and then with Tulu as my fiancé. I saw from the bank how the Soviets were laying a pontoon bridge. The winter was mild, the water high, turbid. A soldier before my eyes fell in and drowned and no one tried to save him. In a short time the old bridge was “patched”, tinkered together, and in such a state had to serve people for a few more years. After it was dismantled its parts were taken to Opole and there it still serves people. For us very normal times had already arrived. Tulu already in January began teaching. He walked on foot from Zawada in wooden clogs, often his entire day’s food was a plate of “dziama” with milk. Schooling took place in various houses all over the city, there were also classes in the tenement in which before the war we had lived. Lila began to attend in Zawada the 6th grade, and Otuś the 2nd, Otuś had a nice navy suit (reworked from Tulu’s) and therefore I put on him, to protect the clothes, a “cobbler’s” apron, until Otuś rebelled and no longer wanted to go to school in an apron. In the spring the children romped outdoors all day. One time Otuś and Ania fell into the manure pit. In Zawada also Ania and Otuś came down with whooping cough, Ania especially went through it badly. I began to look around for an apartment in the city. It was tremendously difficult. Marysia Korpińska (an old friend of ours from the same street) advised me that at Helena, Chełmiecka 3 there is a post-Jewish little house in which poznaniacy are living and who are returning to their parts. I went to the Housing Office and they assigned it to us. Unfortunately, in the meantime Mrs. Sekułowa quickly moved into it with her three sons and did not want to budge from it. I asked at the magistrate’s that some other apartment be assigned to me, they said, however, that they would bring a charge against this lady and she must move out. The matter went to court and Mrs. Sekułowa got an order to move out. (She had a sister on the same street, Mrs. Cieślowa, and at hers she had an apartment) but that did not help and Tulu every day walked kilometers from Zawada. I hit upon a “brilliant” idea, loaded the bundles onto a cart and we moved into half the little house through a window (the house had three little rooms and a kitchen). Only then did Mrs. Sekułowa move to an apartment at her sister’s, and later to a beautiful apartment in the gmina.
Chełmiecka 3.
It was a little house composed of 3 little rooms, a kitchen and a large veranda. It also had a bit of a garden. Tulu taught — I out of necessity only kept house — because they offered me a teaching post far away in the village — in Sącz they did not want to give it to me. It was hard in every respect, both moneywise and for lack of all conveniences. Water far away, kerosene lighting. In the apartment the "furniture" consisted of two beds from Zawada (each different), I borrowed [another] from a former colleague, a simple wooden bed, and there was a "bedroom", the iron one stood in the second little room. There was trouble with mattress ticks because for straw one had to go all the way to Zawada. The "étagères" were made out of UNRRA crates (these were parcels sent by the USA for the starving population), precisely "United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration", an international organization created in the USA in 1943 under the slogan of bringing economic aid to the populations of countries destroyed by the war, dissolved in 1947. The curtains hung on strings. The second room had an iron bed, a huge table from the Jesuits’ boarding school, and chairs that pupils carried in for us, with two nightstands. Tulu acquired somewhere at school a huge wardrobe, which served us both as a wardrobe for clothes and partially as a pantry. We ourselves with Tulu whitewashed the apartment (later every year Hania came from Zawada, or Józia Kulawa’s mother — Przybyłowa). The garden with two apple trees was important; I bought about 2 bushes of "smorodyn". I was very happy with this garden and put a lot of work into it. Tutu earned little. I walked to Zawada for potatoes. They never brought even a measure, perhaps later when we would purchase 3–6 m. for the winter and 2–3 kop of cabbage. Those potatoes I dug for free myself, and naturally I loaded myself down with them like a horse — a backpack full to the brim and two bags, and I went with that 6 km one way. Often I literally had nothing to give the children for supper and then, I remember, during the long June days we simply went to bed. I gave private lessons. Various mothers also came asking for protection with Tula. They wanted to give something — I excused myself and in my heart I asked God that they would insist and leave the present. Queues for food were like a continuation of the war, it was a plague. They would allot 1 kg, sometimes even ½ kg of sugar or flour, and stand for that for hours in a line! The children did not want to line up. I was often pushed out of the line — I had to argue, our children were cross with me on that account. When they started rationing food with cards it was a bit better, but there was too little of it to avoid standing in queues altogether. With clothing — a macabre. Marysia Korpińska worked with American relief and something like 3 times brought a few little clothes in a handbag. Sometimes Ciocia Hela (she worked in Kudowa and her eldest son Kazik attended our lycée, and later all three boys were with us) sent some German-issue "rags", and so one managed, but step by step it was ever better. We were something like 2 times with the children in Kudowa at Hela’s, who in relation to us had a beautiful apartment — one didn’t even want to return from her place to our junk. My head hurt very often, in general in the afternoon I felt like "peas by the path." Otuś probably worried about it the most and sometimes brought me late at night painkillers from the neighbors. Those were probably all effects of wartime experiences and hard work. When the gate creaked, I stiffened with fright. The displaced doctor Isterewicz told me to lie "plackiem", measure my pulse, and take some medicines. This whole "affair" was before Easter; I then directed the children from the bed — Lila was kneading and baking the cake. I rested — I came out of it, and often it then seemed to me that there was no work I wouldn’t be able to manage. And there was plenty of that work, because already on Chełmiecka Street almost without a break, besides our children, there were at first Hela’s two boys and later three. Naturally neither a washing machine, nor water, nor light. To make ends meet somehow I leased a piece of field from Bastowa — our milk-woman. The stay was diversified by Hela’s arrivals — first with the children and then to the children. I remember that for one holiday I started early to accumulate flour and sugar and I then baked cakes from 30 kg of flour. It wasn’t much at all for 6 children. Iwonka was born only on 30-X 1949. For the girls, or rather for Lila, I sewed coats from blankets. One Christmas Eve was with borscht with soap. In winter the kitchen was run in one room. An improvised iron stove, one table the children sat around, a kerosene lamp, dark. In haste I laid the ladle on the soap which attached itself to it and it fell into the borscht. Fish for the holidays we always had a lot — it was the cheapest "dunajcówka". For the Christmas Eve supper we sat on a bench, on the bed, on two chairs, on chests. Tulu would take out several of his tweezers for removing bones from fish. There was always kutia and apple strudel.
The children helped me a lot — there were weekly rotas, the older ones also had to carry water, light the stove, sweep, run errands.
30-X-1948 Iwonka was born. Maybe it was a reaction after the war, or maybe self-defense against approaching old age; enough that we all rejoiced at the birth of Iwonka. I was looking up her names in the calendar. The whole family knew that we were going to have a child. There was a solemn christening. The godmother was Hela and the godfather Olek — my siblings. The children went to school, left for vacations, I was left alone. The aunts found her the name "Iwonka" and that’s how we called her and call her to this day. Only when registering her for school did I find out what Tulu really gave her as a name: Urszula — Elżbieta. That was Tula’s beloved "Koszulka", as Tulu called her. Before Iwonka was born we often went together to the Chełmiec forest, or to Klimkówka — to the woods of my youth. I am enormously fond of orchids, and when I saw them for the first time after the war in the Sącz forest I even screamed with joy. We went to Rytro, Głębokie. Those are also places I went to already in childhood times. It was hard, there was a great deal of work, but the house was pleasant, the little street quiet. We kept dogs, first there was "Ksenia". The children set out to that library and ran into the house with screams that Ksenia was dead. They cried terribly — she was run over by a Soviet car. The second dog was a splendid German shepherd — Reks. He would go bathing with us, go for walks. The end of the idyll came when our house was bought by the barber Jurkowski. Some Jew, an heir, turned up and sold the house. From that moment Jurkowski kept visiting us. He tore off apples, piled up some junk in the yard. He was fixing the roof, until finally he gave poison to the dog. We saved him. We were with him at the vet, gave him milk to drink and the dog recovered. However, not for long, because when he pleased him a second time, nothing helped anymore. That Jurkowski — worse than a beast. Then he kept coming at us so that we would swap apartments with him. He tormented us so much that at last we decided. We gave him a cultivated garden, a clean apartment, and he [gave] an apartment full of bedbugs, and a terrible yard, because Jurkowski kept pigs and a cow. That yard was one manure heap. Work in the garden simply carried me away. We covered the manure heap, we dug over the entire yard and the little garden in front of the house. At first we had all vegetables in abundance, later there was less because the sycamore grew and the large apple trees and shaded part of the garden. There were so many flowers that when there wasn’t money for bread, Olek and Alek would go to the market and sell them. Still, the financial situation was hard, and therefore I bought small piglets, raised them .... in the .... cellar and after some time I called the butcher. Kazik and Lila were already at university. When the piglet was turned into kiszka and kiełbasa, both we and the children in Kraków had what to eat. Exactly when Iwonka was 6 years old we let ourselves be tempted once more to get a dog. It was a little shepherd dog like a ball. He also grew together with the children, he was their favorite, and especially Iwonka adored him. Tragedy befell him already at the present apartment. They poisoned him. I went with Tulu on a trip and Iwonka was alone at home, she lived through it terribly. I don’t want any dog or cat anymore. Szaruś, that kitten from Krzemieniec, also perished from poison. In general the Sącz people are evil — they threw us out of the food lines and threw us out of two houses, they poisoned our dogs, cut down that lovely tree we had planted, covered flowers with sand.
Hela moved in with us for good, together with furniture — I threw out those improvised bits and pieces and it was already so-so at home, but terribly cramped; in the first year on Helena there were 10 of us. In summer half a misery because the little attic room saved us, but winter was awful. Along with that a chronic lack of money, because Hela at first worked as a provisioning manager in a boarding house and earned very little. Tulu taught from morning till night (at times he had over 60 hours a week) but it was all too little, especially when autumn came when one had to supply the house with fuel, with potatoes, cabbage, shoes for the children, coats. Usually when I went to town across the bridge I cried, or I prayed to find some money or that someone from America would send us some. Lila and Kazek already at university, Olek was finishing lycée, Radek and Ania were catching up. I leased a field from Bastowa for potatoes and once even sowed wheat, but I had an awful lot of trouble with it. We washed and dyed old clothes with Hela and remade them into new. We finally hit upon the idea and began to embroider blouses, dresses, collars. Tulu helped us with this because he drew new designs and transferred them. Lila also had her share in it. We embroidered sometimes whole nights. So as not to fall asleep, in summer we embroidered at the open window and on that occasion listened to the nightingales.
At last Hela moved to her own apartment, which she obtained with great difficulty. She took part of the furniture and then we took on installments a light dining room suite. I rejoiced over it terribly. The piano Hela left but temporarily — Iwonka played on it and a bit Ania, and even Lila when she came to Poland from England. Well, but the time for the piano also came — because Kazek Unold took it away. I felt sad because since childhood my dream had been a piano. Violins torment me when someone "saws" on them. I like a violin orchestra. I like the piano immensely, only I can’t stand banging on the keys. I stood on my head and I bought an old piano for 11,000 zł. That piano stands because Iwonka is away from home, and when she comes she plays very little. Lila is not here. Nor is Otusia. Ania far away. The piano is for Iwonka to take. Such was our happiness — our lot, that nowhere could we warm a place for long, and so the little house on Helena had to be left. That little house was cracked, the fissure was visible clear through, but Borus had his kennel there, there were those few beds. Our landlord sold the house to Ms Wróblówna. She bought it very cheaply and began to persecute us so that we would move. We submitted an application to the housing office, we did not want a private house, besides — to where? The housing commissions said we had sufficient square meters, we wrote stacks of applications — in vain, and meanwhile Wróblówna first cut down that lovely sycamore I had planted, then she covered the flowers in the garden with sand, she ripped up a piece of ceiling in the basement rooms, so that the floor in the room next to the kitchen lay only on the joists for something like two winters [typo?: "dwie zimy"]. To that the stoves smoked, I swept out soot twice a year. In the apartment it was so cold that in winter the water in the kitchen constantly froze. What were we to do?! Renovate? With what? For whom? When Lila came with little Romuś (the second time) then Wróblówna had a pit dug next to the house supposedly to check the state of the foundations — we were afraid lest Romuś fall in there. After Lila left I came up with the idea not to whitewash the apartment, not to plug the gaps with plaster but with wadding. It looked awful. With difficulty I called a sanitary commission in winter, which recognized those conditions as inhuman, but again the ordinary housing commission ruled that all those "deficiencies" were to be removed. "And so round and round, Pan Maciej." That wrangle disgusted me terribly!! Wróblówna was obliged to give us an apartment, but she was, in the full sense of the word, a SWINE. That wealthy, solitary woman. When they finally assigned us an apartment she didn’t want to give a penny for the deposit (6,000 zł), for the move, for the apple trees planted by us. We then went into heavy debt both in the ZNP and in the ORS (Obsługa Ratalnej Sprzedaży — Installment Sales Service). If not for Tula’s pupil — Furtek — the costs of the move would have been added to that. There was great trouble with the piles of books, newspapers and other clutter that Tulu in no way wanted to part with, and the little apartment had an area of 46 meters + a small cellar. I came up with the idea and with my own money, with the management’s permission, I fenced off a storage space under the stairs, now we have two cellars, into one we stuffed piles of books and newspapers, the other serves as a handy storeroom. Who and when will make use of those newspapers and old books? Water, a bathroom and radiators are a wonderful thing but the surroundings are awful — a kolkhoz. Our block right in the very middle. There is no balcony — Not an hour can one do without curtains in the evening and by day without net curtains. Smoke from the boiler room billows between the blocks as though through a chimney. Trampled lawns, children’s screams. In the little house on Helena, when at night I embroidered at the open window, I heard the song of nightingales. I yearn for greenery, for a garden bed, I am additionally tormented by the fact that Tulu feels very bad, especially in winter when they fire up the boiler rooms, and because of Biegonice. What a horrible mistake, a downright irreparable loss — those Biegonice. They built a factory of cathode electrodes there (distance some 4 km from Sącz). Beautiful Sącz Land, smoked, asphyxiated. They explain that the main motive was to relieve unemployment and what turned out?! Not even 2,000 people were employed. Unemployment still exists. They "evicted" hundreds of farmers, and the land fertile, beautiful. If instead of that factory they had built, for example, a vacation-tourism complex, how much greater the benefit would have been. I would blow that factory up. In the apartment flowers don’t want to grow. Besides, our girls claim that potted flowers heat up the apartment. I personally would throw out half the junk and put up metal grilles, partition the apartment and hang everything with flowers. I must get flower boxes, at least to have flowers in the summer. And how poor Borus felt! But at least the dog had us. We went out with him for walks. I do not want to describe how he died! Why do people not understand that people can love a dog, a cat! Besides — these are Sącz people! I am ashamed even that I was born here. I have the impression that since they threw us out of houses, poisoned animals, they would poison us too, to have more room for themselves. Before we moved in here, for close to two months I went every day and painted and cleaned the apartment. Now I keep moving the furniture around because I want to introduce a bit of variety into the prison. They were going to bring in gas and new expenses. Now, as I am transcribing this for Lila, the gas is already in, it cost about 10,000 zł. It is convenient but distributing it cost terribly much health and energy because the workmen botch, drink and demand bribes.
I didn’t write anything about the floods on Helena. We lived through one flood on Chełmiecka. The water flooded the street, the garden, it only drove in under the threshold. I took the children and went to a relative on "Paścią Górę". That relative (he is no longer alive) was a forester. From there we watched the flood, there we ate splendid venison (I prefer not to think of the shot little doe). We lived through two floods and several flood alarms at the second apartment, and since the little house had basement rooms they were always flooded almost to the ceilings. During one flood Ania did not manage to leave for her practical training because the water tore up the railway lines and she returned home with a suitcase on her shoulder wading through the little street nearly up to the waist in water. The boys rode in a bathtub and a washtub along the little street. When the water went down, one had to carry out tons of mud from the basement rooms. With us it still wasn’t terribly bad. I saw from the railway track houses by the Dunajec flooded with roaring, muddy water up to the roofs. People were taken out by soldiers on pontoons. They waited for a return to their homes in the gmina whose building stood by the main road (now there are private apartments there). With us too a family of Lup settled in. When it rained for several days in a row there was already an alarm. We would bring up from below a supply of coal, carry all the wood upstairs. We brought in from the well water to drink, I bought bread and sugar, potatoes, and we waited for the flood. We would go out in raincoats to watch how the water was rising in the Dunajec. In the house it was damp and "atmospheric." Iwonka was very afraid, and all night asked how much water had gone down and it was quite the opposite — the water was rising. Here there is no flood, but there is almost every day a flood of smoke.
The people of Sącz.
There’s talk that in bygone times when the Sądeczanie turned to the Starosądeczans (a little town 7 km from Sącz) with a request to borrow a gallows, they were refused, being told that they had it for themselves and their children. That is in general the mentality of the people here. Right after the war I reported myself at the inspectorate with a request for work in Nowy Sącz. I was refused and they kept assigning me to the countryside. Tulu taught at the liceum, the children went to the liceum, there was no transport. The roads were awful. To live in the country with the younger children and run two households?! So I had to give it up and we had to live on Tulu’s meagre pay alone. In Sącz it was all their own people working. Tulu too probably wouldn’t have got a job, but he had already started it in January 1946, and there was a lack of staff with higher education.
Only thanks to great pull (our neighbor Janas was an inspector) did I get in ’58 a job in Biczyce; it was a contract. Buses were already running; besides, I, as much as possible, commuted by bicycle. My zeal knew no bounds; I had longed for this work for years on end. I also studied on my own, because during the years of “unemployment” I had forgotten many things at the black drudge work. In Biczyce I organized performances, excursions; I had good results, and that may have contributed to my getting a job in Chełmiec, this time a regular post. In Chełmiec it was sheer drudgery! Every year I painted benches, doors, windows, set up little gardens, aquariums; I bought teaching aids with my own money, especially for history. I staged performances (for one performance the decorations and costume designs were done for me by Lila, who had just then come from England). That performance even found its way into the press. At the performance, or rather the staging of the poetry of M. Konopnicka, old people cried, even the teachers. I read to the children “from cover to cover” Pan Tadeusz, Sienkiewicz; finally, I was building a school. There, sooner or later, a school had to be built, but my efforts above all hastened the construction by a good few years. The conditions there were awful. The children were crammed into a former C K Austrian building at the crossroads. When cars passed, the ceilings would shake, until once there was a failure, with one ceiling threatening to collapse completely. They shut off our large classrooms upstairs and 2 on the ground floor. In order to get some additional rooms we had to organize a march with the children to the Prez. Pow. Rady Narod. I argued; I was the initiator. They came flying from the Party and finally gave us the keys to an old three-room granary. One classroom had only one window. The children were going blind. I took photographs of these “facilities” and, having faithfully described the conditions (the meeting with the authorities took place in the evening in the Remiza, so no one would have bothered to come to the school anyway), I backed my words with the photographs which I handed to the authorities. A pity I didn’t keep them as a memento. After this meeting the Komitet Budowy Szkoły was formed, and I myself put forward my candidacy for secretary. The whole family helped me in drafting various letters. Otuś helped me very much, who, by virtue of serving as a referent of the spatial planning department, knew the plans for the expansion of Chełmiec and the like. There were many opponents of building the new school; the various intrigues and adversities one would not list even on an oxhide, but at last the building of the school was approved and in that very same year they set about laying the foundations. Within a year a beautiful 12-room school was built. However, such disgust at those people seized me that I moved to N.Sącz. I received a post at the Primary School No. 13 - Cwiczeń. It is a promotion, but there is also an enormous amount of work and very difficult local conditions.
Since I am already on this matter, I will add also my retirement. It was not, despite my 64 years, voluntary. They put me on it by force, for I felt well and the teaching profession is my life’s passion. In anticipation of my being dismissed I submitted an application to the inspectorate and the kuratorium with a request for my further employment. Nothing helped. I copy out here my application.
Curatorium of the School District
of Kraków in Kraków.
On 29 May 1972 I received from the Department of Education in N. Sącz a letter notifying me of my transfer to retirement.
I hereby lodge an appeal against this decision on the following grounds:
I began to copy out that application and gave up. Nuts! They fired me—end of story, period. Just one more thing on this subject. As I fought like a lion against going into retirement, one of the teach. said to me: "It's hard, age comes and one must go. Railwaymen, as soon as they hit 60, must without exception go." I was outraged at such a comparison and said that if a writer hits 60 then he is not allowed to write, a poet to create, a painter to paint.
I fought for and won at least this much, that for a relatively too short period, because only 21 years of work, I was receiving a pension not much smaller than Tulu's. Tulu has 2420 zł – I 2379 zł. Maybe now I will still manage to devote time not so much to the children as at least to the grandchildren! The children and I! Lila was 6, Otuś a mere 2 when the war began. Ania was born at the beginning of the war, Iwonka a short time after the war, and all my effort was directed above all not so much at upbringing as at keeping the children alive. When the situation already began to improve, basically the children had already grown up and began, one after another, to leave the home. I had no time to bring them up in an organized, considered way; besides, the children seemed to me such a part of me, simply my whole, that I often caught myself as if they had been together with me from my earliest years, that they feel and think as I do. My father inscribed for me in such a book - a diary m.p. "Who rises early, the Lord God gives him good" "With truthfulness you will pass through the world" "Love of the Fatherland and honor are the most important good" and the like. I read Rodziewiczówną, Kraszewskiego, Sienkiewicza, Mickiewicza, Słowackiego, Konopnicką. The ideals of those writers became my ideals. I was foolish and I am foolish, although so-called honest. I wrote many things taking place already after the war, but those are, well, the effects of the war.
I would still like to write a great deal about the children, about their youthful years, about their studies and life as grown people. One thing that cannot be changed is this, that their cares, their life, arouse in me a constant fear; they often drive sleep from my eyes. Although many things gladden me, although I would like at least to embroider a few pretty things, because that’s really all I know how to do (I don’t know how to play, I don’t know how to paint), in the end I would rather die so as to stop forever fearing and worrying about the children.
[An erased, almost illegible lament about the children]
We took ... a plot so as to hold on somehow. Our children are good, but a bit cold, and they do not even like one to look at Them, and as for touching, God forbid. One cannot say anything heartfelt either. I go about like a fool and pretend that I am indifferent to them, that everything is in order, what I am writing now too will be criticized and ill received. Lila once told me that in England, in general in the west, as soon as children grow up a bit they part from their parents and hardly take an interest in one another. Can it be so? I know that more than once I made a mistake in our mutual relations, but I never did anything bad with premeditation. Do I know – perhaps Otuś will not worry much about the children, but I do not know whether it will be a matter of indifference to Lili how Romuś is arranging his life. I know, Liluś, that you traverse not only thousands of km to be in Poland, but also to see us.Forgive that at times in anger I blurted out some foolishness, I regretted every bad word and I regret it still. I regret that I watch television when You are here, I do it with premeditation, as if it were nothing since You will soon be leaving. And again I would like to sleep through that time so as not to fear a mishap during Your journey. It is a thousand times easier for Tato, for though supposedly a fatalist he is a thousand times more of an optimist than I. When you were little, Lilusiu, and the doctor found enlarged hilar glands in You, then as soon as I went out into the street I cried out of fear for You. So I am such a scaredy-cat. I know that for You, Lilu, every arrival in Poland is bound up with disappointment. When one longs, one idealizes everything, and here we both, Tato and I, are growing old, and with age many various habits, faults, unpleasant changes in appearance, in the way of moving, come upon us. Well then, youth has its rights and old age cannot have them?
Toward the end I wrote a few “stupidities” and that is mainly why I dawdled about handing over this “diary” and I felt like cutting out the last pages, but here you have it, Lilu.
Mama.
