Me and the war.
Maybe it’s a funny title: “Me and the war,” but as I set about writing down these memories, I wanted to present my personal feelings and the fortunes of my immediate family during the war and after it ended. The composition of my immediate family: I was 32 in ’39. Tulu (my husband) 36. My husband’s mother (Babcia) 70, eldest daughter Lila 6, son Otuś 2, Ania was born on 11 October 1939. There was also a girl—domestic help—Hela. We lived then in Krzemieniec on Objazdowa Street. Tulu was a teacher at the Liceum im. T. Czackiego in Krzemieniec and head of the natural history department at the “Muzeum Ziemi Krzemienieckiej.” I was not teaching then.
In May 1939 the children came down with scarlet fever—strictly speaking it seems to have nothing to do with the war, and yet it does. The children were gravely ill, especially Otuś, and then I resolved that if the children recovered, I would give to the church the most precious thing I had—our wedding rings. The war broke out—the government issued an appeal to replenish the national treasury, so we donated those rings. More than once we talked about how surely someone had taken them and fled (thousands of people were fleeing) abroad, but deep down I did not regret and do not regret that step. My children and Poland are one. I remember how we didn’t leave the speaker when the Germans occupied Czechoslovakia, when the announcer bid farewell to the listeners, when the Czechoslovak anthem was played for the last time. I cried then and began to realize the horror drawing near to us too, to Poland.
On 1 September 1939 mobilization was announced. I will not list exact dates here, only the facts, the experiences that fixed themselves in my memory like images on a durable and precise plate. In the first days of September (or maybe at the end of August) Tadzik’s mother (now my son-in-law) stopped by on her way from Teremne for some treatment and asked our advice on what to do, whether to go on or return home. I advised her to return home and so she did.
Tulu got a double payment for two months, with which I bought some food such as flour, sugar, fat, cocoa (I used that cocoa for a long time to vary my Anusia’s meals). I put these supplies in Babcia’s ironbound trunk, added to that a fairly substantial amount of preserves and juices I had made in the summer, and we waited for the war—the war in Krzemieniec, the war in our house. Events unfolded like an avalanche. People passed through our house and yard like in a kaleidoscope.
The yard was full of cars. Refugees from western and central Poland were fleeing en masse through Krzemieniec and Zaleszczyki to Romania. At night the road leading through the Dubieńska Rogatka (a suburb of Krzemieniec) looked like a shining snake—lights of vehicles, an unbroken stream. The hum of the vehicles reached the apartment. On a certain fine day (probably around 11 September 1939) no one expected a bombing. The refugees had dispersed to buy food and there was plenty of it at the market then (the peasants had already heard about the approaching Soviet troops and supposed that their farms would be collectivized, and so they were selling off their possessions). With the wave of refugees a girl of about 12 reached Krzemieniec. She was entirely without family—we took her in—her name was Janka. On that beautiful morning, after consulting with Babcia, we sent Janka to the market for plums for knedle. Tulu went to register or hand in the radio at the police station. And then the bombing began. German planes dropped low right over the market, packed with people, and machine-gunned the populace directly. At the same time they bombed the entire main street; even the cemetery suffered seriously. Many people died then. The girl—Janka—jumped into the nearest doorway, where out of fear she sat almost until evening. Tulu, in the abandoned police building, lay down under a window and came back safe and sound. I was pregnant with Ania (Ania was born on 11 October ’39), I snatched two-year-old Otuś in my arms, took Lila by the hand, and calling Babcia, I ran and took shelter in the so-called “Skałki Dziewicze.” There were many people there from nearby houses. Babcia began to fluster around, ran into the flat and stayed at home. When we were then all together back home—I with the children and Tulu—we began to worry about Janka. Tulu went to the market and somehow found her and brought her home. From that day on there was alarm after alarm. We took shelter in the cellar, but in the end we stopped reacting to the sirens and sat at home as usual; only little Lila sat in the cellar all day long and, green with fear, dragged us all down there. At last the alarms ceased, and among the people the word spread that Soviet troops were approaching. The end of Poland and, as the Ukrainians said, “Polska łopnęta.” A new partition of Poland ensued—they divided her, the Russians and the Germans. I cried terribly, but I kept moving about the house, cleaning, scrubbing, and crying. One of the refugees, Marek—a miner—began to console me that he was in a worse situation because he was cut off from his family and the Germans were already there, that “the world won’t leave us like this.” We had already learned that England had declared war too. Since 1 September 1939 we had been waiting for the end of the war. The end of the war from day to day. From the first days of September prophecies began to circulate, suppositions that in a month, in 60 days, in 3 months it would end, that somewhere the Polish nation and army were resisting the Germans, etc., etc. I forgot to write that during the last prewar holidays Kazik Unold was staying with us—Hela, my sister—Kazik’s mother—was at a teachers’ course in Zaolzie. She dropped by at the beginning of September, took Kazik and, in accordance with orders of the Polish government, went to Podlis near Kowle to teach. It was a terrible Ukrainian village. Some of its inhabitants were already in September robbing and murdering refugees and Polish soldiers. By happy chance nothing happened to Hela—a trial was held over her composed of the entire village—there was nothing against her, and the trial was presided over by a political officer (politruk) of the Soviet army, who was of Polish origin. Hela even became headmistress of a ten-year school. I had heard a lot about the Bolshevik army and wanted to see it. The Ukrainians put up triumphal arches for them, welcomed them with bread and salt. They marched down the wide (main street of Krzemieniec). The soldiers, short, thin, undernourished, walked in helmets that covered half their faces. Our Ukrainian neighbor women, instead of looking at them, looked at me, and I was choked with tears.
Life in Krzemieniec slowly began to normalize. Some Polish refugees returned to their places in the Gubernatorstwo, some—especially men—fled abroad, mostly to Romania; some were deported to Siberia, and the remnants of the Polish Army fell into Russian captivity. Some were murdered outright by Ukrainians.
One of those who tried to get across the border was Witold Duda—Lotek. He visited us in Krzemieniec around 15 October ’39, said goodbye (under “Poland” he had been postmaster in Stalowa Wola and a reserve lieutenant) and set off toward Zdeszczyk. At the border he was caught by the Soviets and deported to a penal camp in the Komi Republic. Since I am already writing about him, I will finish his story. Only after a year did he write you a laconic postcard from the camp that he was well. That was all the news of him during the war. Only after the war did we reconnect with him and learn how he survived. After receiving the postcard we prepared a parcel (rusks made with eggs and milk, garlic, linden blossom, and some bacon) and with great difficulty sent it—I traveled with it as far as Smygi near Krzemieniec—the Bolsheviks made sending parcels difficult (the weight of the shipment could not exceed 2 kg). They kept designating different points and at different times. That parcel supposedly saved his life because he was already dying of hunger. When the understanding between Stalin and Sikorski was reached—Lotek joined the Anders Army. Along the way he married Danka Musiałówna, who had also been deported to Siberia. Lotek fought in Italy near Ancona. He left the army after the war with the rank of captain. He was in England and then left for Argentina, to Barilosze. He has a son, Andrzej, who is already married, and an adopted daughter. Now he would gladly return to Poland.
But back to us. My delivery was approaching. The yard had emptied of refugees. The girl we took in went back to her parents. On 9 October snow fell unexpectedly. Afraid that the vegetables would freeze in the garden, I dug them out from under the snow and, wet and heavy, carried them to the cellar, and that may have hastened the birth. Around midnight I sent Tulu for the midwife. Babcia was not feeling well, so I stoked the stove myself, put water on, prepared the [becik] and little shirts. Before the midwife had washed her hands—Anusia came into the world. A brave, clever girl. Brave even to the point of risk. She has already been on two “women’s voyages” (there were four women), and now, as I write this, she is sailing with only Kryśia on a small club yacht across the Baltic to the Gulf of Finland. I always worried about her and now enormously, because in the previous voyage they almost paid with their lives. At first Babcia was saddened that it was not a boy, but after a few days she liked Anusia very much. I lay in bed only 3 days, and even then only in snatches, because I had to bathe and diaper the child myself—the midwife did not come and Babcia was afraid.
After Anusia was born the weather turned beautiful. That was when Tulu’s brother, Lotek, burst in on us. Tulu taught in two Ukrainian schools. Polish schools had been abolished. I was a “chadziajka domowa.” Keeping—in fact feeding—the family was no small feat. There were queues for everything, and they were enormous, because many Jews had fled from the Gubernatorstwo to Krzemieniec. At times I would line up at midnight in order to bring home 25 dkg of sugar, or at most half a kilo, and often I came back empty-handed. Sometimes I managed to get some candies (very poor quality) and then there were feasts, because even the grown-ups could have tea “na prekusku.” Sugar was only for the children. Queues for bread. I usually brought home wholemeal bread—we like wholemeal, but the children, and especially little Ania, didn’t. Queues for flour, queues for salt. Polish textiles disappeared like camphor; some people bought them up already in September and the Bolshevik authorities confiscated the rest and exported them. From time to time shipments came in from Russia, but those were unbelievably poor materials. Mainly printed, shabby percales. I once bought (I stood in an enormous line) a few meters—the children, Babcia sewed into pajamas, and I sewed myself a dress. The prints on the pajamas peeled off in the first wash, and my dress looked like a rag after the first queue. In that queue they also tore my dress. I borrowed one safety pin and came home like that. There was no laundry soap. I made lye from ash and lightly soaped the dirtier parts of the linens with toilet soap, because that could be bought from time to time. We would turn the bed sheets to use both sides. Tulu mostly had light, typical shirts with sleeves and washing them was torture—the traditional way, in a washtub and with a washboard.
For milk the peasants did not want to take money, so I gave away coats, shoes, curtains from the house, because there had to be milk for the children. Fuel disappeared, and from almost the beginning of the war until we fled Krzemieniec we burned whatever I dragged from the forest or stole from nearby fences. In the forest I looked for the longest branches possible, tied the thicker end, slung it over my shoulder, and dragged it home. My left shoulder was swollen and sore. There was peat in the vicinity of Krzemieniec, but they sold it only to Ukrainians or to those who worked with it. So I too went to Sapanów. I worked literally on bread and water. I slept on hay at a peasant’s, and by then it was already dangerous because the peasants were preparing to murder Poles. I stacked peat into small piles over a measured area. In the evening I could not straighten my back, and the tips of my fingers bled. Despite everything I persevered for a dozen or so days and brought home large cartloads of peat. That was a treasure, because winter was approaching and I no longer had the strength to go to the forest. I brought that peat just before the war between the USSR and Germany, and under the German occupation a Pole simply had no right to go into the forest, because death threatened from both the Germans and the Ukrainians. It was fortunate that Babcia was at home to look after the children, because I was constantly “on the go”: to the queues, to barter clothes for food, to the forest for wood.
Until the war with Germany we were terribly afraid of deportation to Siberia. At first they deported the families of soldiers, policemen, forestry service, higher officials, families of suspects—and we belonged among them, because Tulu’s brother, Witold, was in a penal camp in Siberia. All Poles were “suspect,” even refugees from the Gubernatorstwo. For fear of deportation I always kept bread rusks and dry pasta on hand, and I nursed Ania until a year and a half. Since Tulu was working, arranging the christening was hard, and besides we were waiting for the end of the war, and then the christening would be solemn within the family circle. Meanwhile the end of the war did not come and Ania was growing, so as a one-and-a-half-year-old girl she went on foot with Babcia and me to church. Our acquaintance Mr Werner and Balcia “held” her for baptism. I am writing “held” in quotation marks because I remember that Ania, in a long cream dress altered from my prewar ball gown, was standing by herself on a chest in the sacristy. Ania was already running and talking well then. Despite the hard times Ania thrived. She began to walk in the ninth month. Babcia was very happy to be godmother; after the other grandmother (my mother) she received the name I like very much—Joanna. As I already mentioned, I was constantly busy, preoccupied; Babcia, on the other hand, told the children lovely fairy tales of her own invention, read to them, fed them. I also read to them a bit, especially Porazińska’s verses. I remember that I made up melodies to almost all the little poems and read them “singing,” and later, when I taught, I also “sang” in the first grades. Lila had just before the war passed her first entrance exam to first grade of the practice school at the Liceum. Naturally she passed it well, especially as regards colors. In September 1939 Lila began first grade, but since “Polska Topła” the language of instruction was Ukrainian and Lila didn’t know it at all—and besides we expected the end of the war any day—so we took Lila out. I remember that classes were held on Sundays too and that put me off as well, and Lila stayed home. I taught her reading and writing here and there—she learned quickly; arithmetic was harder, but only now do I realize that Lila was a clever girl, because she learned the four operations up to 20 and then 100 without manipulatives or much explanation. Little Otuś listened to fairy tales and rode a lot with Dad on the bicycle. Otuś was born with black hair already—I too was a brunette—and when I walked with Otuś everyone took us for Jews. The children had only a few toys. Just before the war Otuś got a little monkey, and we fled Krzemieniec with that monkey; that monkey was still knocking about in Helena in Sącz. I regret not keeping it. Instead of toys the children had lots of little books, paints, paper, crayons. Early on Otuś began to draw tiny little figures—the pages teemed with [drawing of stick figure] and I sang to them.
I am a beggar, beggar
What will I eat, eat
I’ll go to the little market
I’ll buy a little loaf of bread
I will eat it, eat
" " " .
These were the sweetest moments in those macabre times. One could not reconcile oneself to the fact that everything was “Topło” [‘melted’], as the Ukrainians said. It seemed to me that I could keep it all together if the house was clean. I don’t know where I got the strength, the energy from. The first Easter holidays were approaching. I baked some cookies and bought a quarter of a pig from clandestine slaughter. I made lots of sausages. I polished the floors and washed the runners. These were the most wonderful holidays in the entire war. There was even spirytus at home, which Tulu received from the division [distribution] from the Muzeum Ziemi Krzemienieckiej. For this spirytus I received produce from the peasants. Tulu slept in a separate room, with a pile of books by him because he was preparing for lessons. I with the children and Babcia in the bedroom. At midnight I hear the sound of bells on a sleigh (although it was Easter, snow was coming down—the holiday was in March). It was the time of deportations to Siberia. Someone is pounding on the door from the courtyard side. I open in my nightgown and several Bolshevik soldiers barge into the apartment. One took position by the door with a rifle and the rest scattered through the apartment. Tulu berat. [unclear] They conducted a search, went through the books. Babcia was somehow unwell and was trembling with fear, begging the soldiers for her son’s life. Next .... they ordered that they be given vodka (I diluted our entire supply of spirytus with juice), I served the leftovers of meat, lard, garlic, and onion. They drank, ate, wrestled among themselves, made a mess all over the house, and left toward morning. With difficulty I got the apartment back in order.
The matter of the relatives - Majków.
Gena Majkowa—Tula’s cousin—wrote to us at the beginning of the war. She wrote that her husband Adam—the headmaster in Małoryta near Chełm Lubelski—had died, and she—(his wife)—was left without means to live on, with three children. After some deliberation we wrote her a letter to come to us, that somehow we would scrape by together. Despite the war I kept the flat clean, floors polished, clean bedding. We took her in like our own, into our beds, into the shared kitchen. After a short time I realized that lice from them had overrun us, and from then on, for almost the whole war, lice and lice, and here there was no soap, [soda], both under the Bolsheviks and the Germans. The second matter was the shared food. Genia did not want to give up good eating. She sulked when, for example, milk soups were half and half with water, when I divided meat among several dinners. The third matter was her eldest son, Tadzik. The boy at the beginning of the war was about 14 and stole habitually. He robbed us, he robbed his mother, he “sponged off” acquaintances by invoking kinship with us. I suppose that was the parents’ fault. He was one of twins. His brother died, and over Tadzik the parents doted and allowed him everything. At the moment when they came to us, Tadzik was about 14, Krysia about 3 years old, and Ceśiu about 2. At that time we occupied 3 rooms, a balcony and a kitchen. I cannot stand that Tadek, I separated myself—ceding them one room and a place in the kitchen. Genia went to work at the brewery. We could, however, have lived together under one roof if not for Tadek. Even the Milicja came to us because of Tadek. There was no help—we had to move out. The owners of a vacant flat demanded six months’ rent in advance. We sold for this purpose my gold Omega watch, Tula’s suit, added from Tula’s pay, and we moved. We were, as they say, quite “broke”, without money, without food, but in the house on Lipowa Street there was peace. Not for long, however, because the war between the Germans and the Z P P R [USSR] came.
On Lipowa Street we lived on the upper floor. We also had 3 rooms, a balcony, a little kitchen. One small room was hung with beautiful display cases with insects. The display cases were made by a carpenter according to Tula’s design, at our expense. The collections were beautiful; they remained in the Krzemieniec museum. The work and value truly priceless. Ever since I met Tula he was always collecting something; there was not a single excursion that took place without some purpose, and above all catching insects and collecting plants. At night we would also go out with white sheets and flashlights for moths. All our belongings remained in Krzemieniec: insects, plant collections, books, paintings, furniture, dishes, bedding.
The Germans
One day Tulu came back from a conference and says that something is “in the air” and that the inspector, a Russian, was reassuring the teachers and advised them to go for a walk to Góra Bona (there were then, and still are, ruins of Bona’s castle there. From that hill there is a beautiful view of Krzemieniec and the immediate surroundings). The next day there was a stir in the town. There was nothing to eat at home. I took Ania in my arms and stood in the “queue” for bread. I was standing on Szeroka Street when suddenly shooting began; two Germans on a motorcycle appeared on the street. Fortunately Tulu left the house, found me, snatched Ania up in his arms and we jumped into the stream flowing right behind the houses. The streets emptied at once. Along the stream we went up, ran across Szeroka Street, jumped onto our little street and into the house, but without bread, which from then on we constantly lacked; from then on hunger took up residence in our house. One enemy fled—the other seized us. The Soviets, just before the Germans entered, murdered all the prisoners. People returned from the prison in tears, and some recognized among the bestially murdered—their relatives, acquaintances.
Hunger under the German occupation
Tulu worked at the Museum, an institution the Germans only ostensibly tolerated but in fact tried to destroy. They issued, for example, orders to vacate the existing museum premises within a single day. The staff frantically looked for another place and carried the exhibits on their backs themselves. I remember that Tulu earned so little that for a whole month’s “salary” you could buy one kilogram of butter on the “black market.” It was self-sacrificing work, but the museum survived and exists to this day, together with Tulu’s insect display cases and the enormous plant collections.
The food rations were not enough to keep even one person, and here we had to feed three children and three adults. Once a week I brought three-quarters of a barley loaf, which we ate immediately (the next day it turned bitter and crumbled like sawdust), a bit of disgusting marmalade, and from time to time a dozen-odd dekagrams of meat. I traded anything in the house for food. Coats, curtains, leather briefcases (people made shoes from them), paintings. For Babcia’s black coat with a sealskin collar I got close to one meter of wheat. That was a treasure. We ground this golden grain on quern stones hidden from the Germans. I made [zalewka], noodles from the flour, and to the bran I added grated red beets and baked flatcakes on the stove. The mother of our landlords, who was staying in the countryside with the pop’s son, found out about this wheat. She asked to borrow that wheat because she wanted to grind a larger amount, and that she would bring it right back from the village and return it to us. She took it, and that was the last we saw of her. That was inhuman, because the Ukrainians were the Germans’ favorites and had food in abundance. I exchanged, for example, beautiful curtains for 25 kg of millet groats. For an entire month, apart from that groats and 1 liter of milk a day, we ate nothing else. I received 30 liters of milk for two beautiful, hand-embroidered pictures of the Mother of God and the Lord Jesus. Tulu, returning from work, would surreptitiously get 2–3 sugar beets, from which I baked flatcakes with added bran, or boiled down “honey.” Another time I traded some garment for a little rye, which Tulu and I ground on the museum’s quern stones. For a time I took in two pupils, the pop’s children, as boarders [na stancji]. The payment was food: some potatoes, flour, and lard. It was paradise, but it didn’t last long, because the pop took his children away from the Poles. Mr Niedźwiecki lived with us for a while; he had family in a village and thus had his own food, he paid us something for the lodging, but I pilfered “a little something” from him. I remember once, starving, I ate a piece of sausage, but I fell terribly ill—“stolen goods don’t fatten.” That Mr Niedźwiecki was a great patriot; he went to Warsaw, took part in the Uprising, and apparently was killed. I write “went” but these were escapes at the risk of one’s life. Tulu brought caustic soda from the Museum, and we made soap. Soap was made not only from tallow, which was very hard to come by, but also from eggs, from hens, from carrion, with the addition of peas for better foaming. I went around the villages with this “commodity” and traded it for whatever I could, and it was already dangerous—the Ukrainians were preparing to murder Poles. Tulu got from the Museum a small bucket of salt (I don’t know how that salt ended up there). The director at the time was a Ukrainian; he could have given us more but preferred to give to his own, some even got a meter of salt [possibly a large measure]. Salt was also scarce under the German occupation. That salt helped us a bit too. I remember that once I traded 1 glass of salt for a hen. Unfortunately, the hen either fell ill with us or the woman had given us a sick one. I couldn’t come to terms with the loss of the hen. I doused it with water to bring it round and poured sour milk into its beak, and I cured the hen. Formerly, my Ukrainian neighbor would kill poultry for me; now she didn’t want to do that for a Polish woman. Tulu accomplished that deed. He took the hen and on a chopping block cut off its head, but he came out of the shed so pale that I never again turned to him in such a matter. And we also had to share this food with a Jewish woman. The Germans, or rather the Ukrainian militia, drove Jews from the ghetto to work. On the way one Jewish woman would drop in to us asking for food. I always gave her something, whether a few potatoes or a handful of some groats. Once I literally had nothing at home, and as proof I showed her the peelings from the last potatoes. The peelings were wafer-thin (as we say where we live, you could see [Kraków] through them), I gave them to the Jewish woman at her request. In general potatoes were a delicacy. Mostly I cooked them in their skins. Once I had only a few, too few to eat them on their own. So I made pierogi from them, and since I had only rye flour, I kneaded the dough from that; I “dressed” the pierogi with onion browned in a little cream. The children were very pleased; Lila even wrote about it in her little diary (it vanished somewhere, which is a great pity). Once we got from a museum co-worker some poor plums (it was Obolończyk—he is now a doctor in Kijów). I also kneaded dough from wholemeal flour and made “knedle,” I poured saccharin dissolved in water over them. Otuś called from the balcony or from the window to his peer Dzidka Targońska that we were having knedle for lunch. Tulu got a bit of food by riding his bicycle to Chodak to Hela. He brought cabbage from her, a little groats. The rides were dangerous because the Ukrainians were already well and truly preparing to go after the Poles. Tulu took roundabout routes and skirted villages. Once he took his winter coat to a peasant to trade. He got a goose and a bit of honey for it; there was a feast for several days. Sometimes one of the Unolds would come to us—(Jan from Szumska or Apolinary from Chodak). They almost always brought meat from a clandestine slaughter to sell. I distributed it among acquaintances. It was a very dangerous operation for those times. For such things the Germans even punished with death. I kept scraps for ourselves, for which I also paid them. In general we could have not suffered hunger because they (the Unolds) lived in the countryside and had it in abundance. But the sated don’t believe the hungry, and they were killed. Our drinks were tea made from toasted apple peels, from linden blossom or strawberry leaves. I think the one from strawberry leaves was the best. I also tried to make acorn coffee from toasted halves, but it was Sisyphean work because I could never grind them, nor even crush them in a mortar. I’ve gone on at such length about this hunger, but it was an enormous problem that, in fact, rested on me.
The death of Babcia Dudowa
It is actually connected with that hunger. Babcia was vigorous, and if not for the war she would have lived much longer. She liked meat, fats, and then suddenly hunger; so she weakened a great deal. One time Julek Unold (Aunt Hela’s husband) came to Krzemieniec with a consignment of tobacco. He stopped by and talked me into going to Chodak (40 km) so that I could bring back some food. I pulled out the remaining clothes for barter and was just about to leave, when Babcia made a scene at me for leaving them alone. I explain that after all I will bring home some bacon, flour, butter, but Babcia stayed angry. I was already downstairs and about to get onto the cart, but “something nudged me” — I turned back and said a heartfelt goodbye to Babcia. To this day I regret that I left then, because after all Babcia would have lived longer. In Chodaki I bartered the clothes primarily for fat, and every day I went to the quern to grind wheat, because Julek told me that however much I ground, that much I could take with me to Krzemieniec. Hela and I would go together (Hela was pregnant with Alek then) because they too were grinding for themselves on the quern. I was terribly impatient, and that neighbor, who also was to go with a consignment of tobacco, kept delaying the departure because the Germans were not allowing anyone to leave Chodak. Only after about 10 days did I leave Chodak, and on the way, in Szumsk, I received a telegram that Babcia had died. It was at the end of winter. The apartment was cold. To get to the kitchen you went through the hall - the kitchen was above the stairs. Babcia warmed herself by the stove in the room, and she would go out to the kitchen to cook something for the children and must have come down with pneumonia. Before Tulu realized and called a doctor, it was already too late. If I had been there, maybe she wouldn’t have caught cold, or I would have put cupping glasses on Babcia right away and she would have been saved. I cried terribly, and I still grieve for her. I know that if she were alive now she would be about 100, but I feel sad that she doesn’t watch television, doesn’t listen to music, and she was very musical. She doesn’t enjoy the grandchildren — or maybe she does?! I beg my mama for care over my children, and perhaps ask her, Babcia Dudowa, for it too? Together with Tulu we put up a little monument on her grave (three years ago, in 1970), and somehow I feel lighter. In life she would go for walks to the “Cmentarz Tunicki,” sit on the grave of Słowacki’s mother, and say to Lili that she would bring her (Babcia) flowers because she wanted to be buried here. That is what happened - her grave is right next to the grave of Salomea Słowacka. I remember that I sewed tights from my red sweater for Ania (from the sleeves) and for Otuś (from the back). The children (Ania and Otuś) had no notion of death and were chasing each other around the catafalque. Babcia’s old accordion remained in a trunk in Krzemieniec.
Jews
We were lately living in such a wilijka [attic room/outbuilding?] upstairs, and downstairs, right after the Germans entered, Jews moved in. It was a very wealthy childless family. They wanted to leave some things with us for safekeeping. Tulu, however, absolutely would not agree. One time, when we had both gone out of the house, they begged Babcia and basically forced in a pile of suitcases and beautiful fluffy blankets. I returned from town and “laid into” Babcia with reproaches. Tulu came back and firmly ordered me to take that luggage back to the Jews. Tulu was convinced that keeping things—and even more so using them, taking advantage of them—of Jews so cruelly persecuted would bring misfortune down on us as well. Maybe he was right?! I returned it and I do not regret it. The Jews were taken to the Ghetto—they surely perished. It is monstrously cruel, a terrible disgrace for the Germans and the Ukrainians who with all their heart helped to liquidate and persecute the Jews. I remember how the Ghetto burned, how a shootout broke out because the Jews defended themselves. I wandered like a madwoman, my head hurt without pause. And yet one had to live. I gathered a whole bag of old shoes to use them to repair the three most serviceable pairs. Bad luck had it that the cobbler lived opposite the gate of the ghetto. I saw a vehicle driving out of it. It was a truck loaded with Jews. They were crammed in, hunched over, because on their backs lay a huge wooden “deka” [cover/planking], and on it sat several Ukrainian militiamen with rifles ready to fire. Tulu’s apprentice saw with his own eyes how over the common graves—pits—planks had been thrown, on which the Jews, stripped naked, stood, and they were shot by Gestapo men. They had machine guns resting on tripods; when they got tired of killing, they lit a cigarette, had a bite to eat, and back “to work.” The next day they drove a road roller over the graves covered with lime and soil.
One day, shortly after the Germans entered, I went and stood in line for bread; because they took me for a Jewess, the Ukrainians began to murmur, to look at me menacingly. Fortunately, a neighbor (a Pole) was standing not far away, who had lived in Krzemieniec since birth and therefore was better known than I, and she began to explain that I was a Catholic Pole and not a Jewess.
Still, I did not get any bread, even though I proved myself to the shopkeeper with a chain with the Mother of God, and I witnessed a cruel scene. I overheard a commotion and screams coming from the neighboring entryway and saw a Jew in a caftan with sidelocks burst out into the street. Several people ran after him, but “people” from the queue joined them; they grabbed stones and literally stoned that Jew. The little street was neither paved nor asphalted. Once I saw an old Jewish woman carrying on a “koromysła” [shoulder yoke] two wooden pails of water; the road went uphill, down which a sled came with the carter standing on it. The peasant deliberately drove into the Jewish woman, who got under the sled, and they dragged that screaming Jewish woman along, and the peasant brandished his whip and did not stop. I too screamed in horror.
Ukrainians
Poles in the Gubernatorstwo were persecuted by the Germans in a terrible way, but for us in the so-called Ukraine it was probably even worse. In the Gubernatorstwo it was the Germans against the Poles, and here yet another terrible enemy joined in: the Ukrainians, and we were a minority. The Ukrainians matched the Germans step for step. It was they who handed us over to the Bolsheviks and later to the Germans. It was they who delivered truly very valuable people to death (prof. Opolski, Mączak, Sawojcówna, Torgoński, Szynajowiecz, and many, many others). This awaited us, and above all Tula, as well, but the eastern front began to approach and so we fled. Prof. Mączak was the founder of the Museum, Dr. Opolski wrote a treatise on Hitlerism just before the war. One hears nothing about Ukrainians imprisoned and perishing in concentration camps. Ania had some severe pains; she cried at times. No wonder, if at home there was, for example, only rye flour (Maybe that is why I don’t like rye bread so much). So I took Ania in my arms and went to the “Gebitskomisarza” for semolina for Ania. I waited perhaps two hours to be admitted before the dignitary. I explained my request to the Ukrainian interpreter, and they jabbered among themselves and didn’t give me even 25 dkg of semolina. The Ukrainians at first betrayed us and informed the Bolsheviks — never would so many of us have been deported to Siberia, taken to prisons, shot, if not for the Ukrainians. As soon as the war began the Ukrainians were in contact with the Germans via transmitting stations, they murdered refugees from western Poland, etc., etc.
The death of Julek Unold, his brothers, the death of thousands of Poles at the hands of the Ukrainians.
Informing on Poles, arrests by the Germans and murdering them went on all the time. Then the Ukrainians themselves began murdering individual Poles, then entire villages, settlements. At Easter news came from Chodak that Julek Unold had been murdered, that this and that acquaintance had been killed in the county, and then a whole avalanche of murdered Poles, entire families with children, the elderly, entire villages. The Poles defended themselves, fled to larger concentrations—they organized themselves (Read “Czerwone noce” by Cybulski). Many Poles from the surrounding villages found themselves in Krzemieniec, whole phalanxes of refugees, already under the cover of German rifles, were heading to Krzemieniec. For some time I went out every day to the “Wiśniowiecka Rogatka” and, in tears, waited for Hela with the children. I saw those poor people, some on wagons, others on foot with bundles and children. They slept on boards in the lyceum church, they dispersed among Polish homes; from the German side there also awaited them the danger of deportation for labor to Germany. The Poles—the inhabitants of Krzemieniec—organized things for them and helped as best they could. I, together with Mrs Doroszukiewa, also cooked a bucket of soup several times. We chipped in together for it. Mostly it was potatoes with dumplings. The soup was with omasta. I went around the Ukrainian neighbors and directly demanded fat. Some gave, like the Skibinieccy; others, like the spiteful Ukrainian woman Turkowa, didn’t want to give a single slice. When, outraged and shaken, I spoke about it, she told me: “well, that’s tough, where they chop wood, chips fly.” Phalanxes—whole wagon trains of Poles—were leaving their settlements, until finally in one train there was Unoldowa Maria with two children—the wife of Jan Unold, cruelly murdered in Szumsk. She lived with us. Right after our escape from Krzemieniec, she too managed to escape. She lived in Opole. The children got an education, married. She has already died of cancer. Hela, on the other hand, fled with the children to Ostróg—from there to Bożęcin near Tarnów, where at that time two of our brothers, Kazek and Staszek, lived. Of the four Unold brothers, only one, Apolinary, was miraculously saved, and three perished. One of them, Florian—the head of a school near Kowel—was killed together with his wife Danka, precisely at Easter. The nine-year-old eldest son (Zbyszek) and his two younger brothers (one was an infant) survived. The godparents of one of them from Kowel took care of them, but when they later fled from Kowel, the youngest little boy was shot and also died. The eldest—Zbyszek—buried his mother and father himself, and had only a Ukrainian teenage friend to help. The Sołtys was afraid to take on the burial because it was forbidden to bury “Lachów.” He was afraid to give those children a cart so they could go to Kowel. The son of our landlady was a militiaman. We had a bicycle and he borrowed it almost every day. Tulu from the museum would come and yell at me for having lent out the bicycle. I would go to them as if to the scaffold and ask for it back (they lived in an outbuilding in the yard). They gave it back to me with a sullen look. It was like that a dozen or so times, but we saved the bicycle and sold it just before our flight from Krzemieniec.
One day people started milling about the yard, speaking Ukrainian among themselves. I asked them what they were doing there, and they said they had fled from Rybcza (a village near Krzemieniec) from the Ukrainians. Surprised, I said that after all they were murdering Poles, not Ukrainians—then I got the answer that they were Poles but did not know Polish. The Ukrainians do not ask whether one is from this land since grandfather and great-grandfather; they just murder, and they also murder mixed marriages.
Our children during the war
Lilusia felt those times the most; in 1939 she was 6 years old. She most often hid in the cellar during air-raid alarms; with all her might she wanted there to be a home, and yet everything was falling apart. She had enlarged hilar glands [hilar lymph nodes], and I was terribly worried about her. In our family three siblings had died of tuberculosis; Tulu’s brother died of tuberculosis. Whenever I went out of the house I cried, and here the child was going hungry. Our neighbor’s husband, Mr Kruczkowski, was the manager of a state estate, thus a German one. They were living then in the countryside in a manor house (in Buchłów); they had everything in abundance. They offered to take Lila in for a while.
She had attentive care, splendid fare—dairy, meat, fruit—but what of it; Lila sought secluded places in the park and cried. The doctor who visited them said she was crying for home. Tulu went by bicycle and had to bring her home. She insisted that for one Easter (it was our last holiday there) we whitewash the house. I had a broken arm in a cast then—luckily the left one—so with my right hand I whitewashed and washed. Her First Holy Communion took place in the lyceum church. She attended preparations very briefly. She had a borrowed little dress; the wooden sandals—Tulu made them. The upper part was from my white felt hat. I prepared a wreath and a candle, and I let down her beautiful hair, and she had long braids then. When the neighbor women—Poles—learned that Lila was going to First Holy Communion, they brought her a veil at the last moment and pinned it on her head themselves. Babcia did not live to see that moment, and Lila went to church alone, for I had no one to leave the children with, and I was ashamed to go with the children because I had nothing to dress them in. I did not have much time to look after her education, and Tulu didn’t know how. Once she had almost taught herself to read and write, Tulu would give her his student “textbooks” and make her read aloud. Of course she later told me she understood nothing of them. All told, throughout the entire war, as I calculated, Lila attended school only 15 months. A few months in Zmigrod, a few weeks in Turza, and a few months in Zawada. In N. Sącz she immediately went on to secondary school. In some subjects she had more than a good grasp—of others she had not the slightest idea. In his free time Tulu painted; he also gave Lila paints and cardboard, and I remember her first picture: it was a fir sprig in a little vase. Where are you now, my Lilusia?!
Otuś was 2 at the outbreak of the war. Like Lila, he had had scarlet fever. Lila had enlarged hilar glands [hilar lymph nodes], and Otuś a murmur in his little heart. The child was growing; there was nothing to dress him in. I didn’t know how to sew, which was simply a misfortune, especially in wartime; besides, I didn’t have a machine. Since childhood I had always liked to embroider. I couldn’t afford a dressmaker during the war, a hairdresser was out of the question as well, so I cut Otuś’s hair myself “à la pot” [bowl cut]. I cobbled together some shirts and blouses by hand, but they looked “pożal się Boże” [pathetic]. Otuś was often ill. In Krzemieniec he came down with pneumonia, and here there was neither doctor nor medicines. We had acquaintances who worked in a German military hospital, and from them we got some pills, only I don’t remember what kind—and I put on branki [bańki, cupping], and somehow it helped him just as it had helped Lila. Education consisted above all of piles of prewar “Płomyczek” issues and Babcia’s stories, and from time to time my reading children’s books to them. I liked to sing to the children and I still marvel at myself how I could do that in such macabre times. The children’s education also included Tulu’s bicycle outings with Otuś and Lila in turns. They rode through the forests, they rode to the [Ikwę] until the Ukrainians began to murder, for then one couldn’t even “stick one’s nose” out of the town. I taught Otuś to read and write in his sixth year during regular lessons with Bogna, Nusia’s daughter. This was already after our escape from Krzemieniec. From his earliest years Otuś made plańiki [plany, little maps] and liked to look at atlases. I remember how, after my arm had been set, I was coming back from the hospital after a night spent there. I was returning to the children anxious and at the same time happy, and from afar I saw Ania and Otuś standing on the little porch. As I began calling to them, the children disappeared into my small barrel that stood on the small balcony. They (the children) thought I had been completely deprived of one arm, and that’s why they hid. Anusia, as they say, was born under bombs. As long as she was an infant there was no problem, for she had a carriage, a pillow, and shirts after Otuś, but the older she got, the worse it was. Her first little dress was reworked from a wall hanging of gray linen, but the little dress was sewn by a seamstress; I only embroidered it with stars. She later had more little dresses, but this one I remember most. Babcia admired her wise, large eyes, but she remembers Babcia little, for she was barely 2 when Babcia died. Often up to a year and a half she cried; evidently she had some pains, but nothing strange—sometimes even animals die from rye [from hunger]. She had no toys, of course. I would tell her at the age of 3–4 how Oluś and Lila used to throw bananas and oranges under the bed before the war—Ania would ask what those fruits looked and tasted like. I remember how once I got hold of bolted flour, and Ania didn’t want to eat dumplings made from it, saying she didn’t want such sticky dumplings. In Zmigrod near Jasło she was probably about 4 already, and although she was truly an exceptionally bright little girl, she couldn’t pronounce “r”. Mr Kahl—a worker at the dairy—was delighted and paid her for reciting a little poem,
A black cow, in burgundy spots,
It was chewing grass, twisting its muzzle.
Damn it, where did so many “j”s come from here.
The Żmigród period was a separate stage for the whole family. I tried to send Ania to the nuns (in Żmigród) who ran something like a kindergarten. I would give her a bottle of milk, a slice of bread with butter (in Żmigród Tulu worked in a dairy run by Nusia), but Ania didn’t want to play with the other children and stopped going. The children played best together as a foursome: Ania, Otuś, Bogna, and Kazek Unold (I took him to stay with us from Hela, who at that time was teaching in Lezach near Borzęcina). Lila did not take part in those games. Sometimes the children went wild, and Ania led the way, and in those games she always showed the greatest courage. I remember when Mrs Kruczkowska came to us (she too had fled from Krzemieniec and was living near Jasło). Nusia, I, and Mrs Kruczkowska couldn’t talk ourselves out with each other—the younger children were playing, and Lila disappeared; after a while I found her behind a curtain in a corner (that storage nook served us as a clothes closet), she was sitting hunched up and crying... because she couldn’t stand the bustle and the loud talking. Our children were a bit strange. I have to go back to Otuś, who fell ill with pneumonia again. Aunt Nusia had gone off somewhere; I cooked dinners at her place for two households and took care of Julek, Nusia’s husband, who had tuberculosis. It was very hard for me to look after a bunch of children and two sick people. There was a doctor we knew, Dr. Rezacz (he was murdered by the Gestapo because he treated wounded “Akowców” [Home Army]), and he prescribed and gave us prontosil and only aspirin. It seems that it was the aspirin and the cupping that helped the most. I must still write about the further “education” of the children, especially Ania. When fate tossed us as far as Zawada near N. Sącz, we settled there with our relatives, the Zarębas. Wanting to repay them, I undertook to teach two of their children, Józka and Hania, to read and write. Besides that, I took on two more neighbors’ children for lessons. Ania steadfastly kept pace with me in those lessons, although I wasn’t really teaching her, because she was not yet fully five then, and those other children were already seven. I did have to buy her notebooks, and Otuś and Lila “assigned” her [assignments]. In a short time Ania was already reading newspapers, while those other children were still spelling things out from the primer.
Again I return to the Krzemieniec times, to my broken arm. It would have been a trifle in normal times, but in wartime it is a small tragedy. I had obtained for a piece of soap 2 liters of buckwheat, but unmilled. It was early spring when I went with it to the hand-mill at some people we knew. I ground the buckwheat; a woman I knew sifted out the husks for me and on top of that let me have 2 liters of milk. Overjoyed, I hurried back so as to get home before dark, and a stretch of the way led through the forest. I was walking downhill and went nose-first onto the ground, which was covered with ice. I braced myself with my hand and it “snapped.” I got down to the main road, but I didn’t stop in at home; instead I passed the backpack with the milk and flour to the children and sent for Tulu, who was giving lessons to students doing the high-school classes. Tulu took me to the hospital. My arm had swollen, and at the hospital they wanted to cut the sleeve of my fur coat—the only warm outer garment I had. I didn’t allow it—they managed with difficulty to take off that fur coat, and the arm was set under anesthesia. The fracture was complicated and displaced, but it knit well, and to this day I don’t feel any pains in that arm. I wore my arm in a cast for six weeks, and that was a nightmare, because I couldn’t comb the children’s hair or my own, and I also wore two braids over my ears that I tucked under; that was my hairstyle. Tulu did our hair, but very clumsily. Babcia was no longer alive then.
Christmas trees
I think in those hard times I was very resourceful and tried somehow to keep this “home” going, and there was a Christmas tree every holiday. One holiday under the German occupation there was an announcement that under no circumstances was one allowed to have a Christmas tree, and worse still to bring one yourself from the forest. Two stubborn creatures, Gena Mojkowa and Gena Duda, went to the nearest German estate. In the park fence they found a hole and cut down two beautiful Christmas trees in the park. It was already late at night when each of us brought the children a Christmas tree. The underground press was a great joy to us. Often those little papers were already barely holding at the folds; after reading we passed them to a neighbor, naturally only to a Polish woman. We copied out various prophecies and they heartened us greatly — “hope is the mother of fools.” We still have them — maybe if I manage, I will copy them for the children. Oh, how we waited for the end of the war. My dearest dreams were, in my mind, to welcome Polish soldiers, and deep down I was sure of it, and I considered the marching Germans defeated from the start.
Somehow I managed to get in touch with Nusia, who was then in Zmigrod. She was faring far better than we were, but she couldn’t really help us because from the Gubernatorstwo one could send parcels of only 25 dkg. Nusia sent me two small parcels with new stockings. Naturally I sold them at once, and with that money I bought an iron stove with one “fajerka” [burner plate]; it saved us greatly because I set it in the room and so it warmed us at the same time and I could cook on it. I would have forgotten to write about one important thing. They gave us from the Słowacki Museum to keep in safekeeping the manuscript of Balladyna. Słowacki’s handwriting was like little pearls, even, clear, on magnificent paper. Besides that there were also poems there, such as “Smutno mi, Boże,” which Słowacki illustrated in pen. You could see he was an artist in every sense of the word. I didn’t know where to keep this treasure. Among the books I was afraid that in case of a search they would find the manuscript, and after all by hiding it under the mattresses I was exposing it just the same. I wrapped it in linen cloth and from time to time looked through it. The only thing the Germans did not liquidate was the Słowacki Museum located in the manor house where Słowacki was born. (At present the Soviet authorities have turned this little house into a library and have stacked the exhibits in the form of furniture in the attic above the general museum. In this museum there is only a small room with two display cases in which there are some mementos of Słowacki). The curator under the Germans was Dr Kryński; he was a cripple but a very educated man; he had a young and pretty wife. I was in that museum several times and I liked it there immensely: silence, perfect order. Around the little house apple trees grew; we got apples from them. We were in Krzemieniec three years ago and saw everything. You can see clearly that they are destroying all mementos and traces of Polishness. Since I am already on cultural matters, I must still mention the fate of the enormous library that was at the T. Czacki Lyceum. It had all the newest publications and, besides that, the so-called black and white ravens of our literature [rarities]. When the Bolsheviks entered Krzemieniec — Tulu worked at the Museum (he was head of the natural history department), so he had access to the lyceum buildings. He came once and, as they say, almost cried, because he saw how the Bolsheviks lit a bonfire in the courtyard and were burning and tearing beautiful books. Tulu surreptitiously brought some books, but when we fled from Krzemieniec it all was lost. One fellow saved Słowacki’s manuscript (I didn’t remember his surname), who managed to make it to Warsaw. All trace of the manuscript was lost. Had it stayed with us, it would have survived.
More about the Museum. Before the war Tulu simply devoted his life to collecting (he still does so now). As a small boy he began with matchboxes. Then he collected books, chemicals, plants and insects (now stamps, newspapers, and of course books). He collected insects with great expertise and passion. A carpenter made the display cases for him at our expense. The insects had their antennae and legs set to tenths of a millimeter; the larger insects were prepared, and, for example, caterpillars were inflated. At night the two of us hunted moths. Every walk was combined either with catching insects or collecting plants. Even little Lila paid attention to insects, which she called “eku.” I sometimes looked askance at it, because we were not rolling in money and the cases cost a lot. There were 32 of those cases. At the outbreak of the war Tulu concentrated those cases in the house. One room was hung all around with them. In each case there was an ampoule with a moth-killing agent. The cases are very tight. When we fled from Krzemieniec Tulu gave those cases to the Museum “for safekeeping,” and there they have remained to this day. When we were there with Tulu three years ago we saw them — they are beautifully preserved. Tulu now intended to open them, but I dissuaded him for fear that precisely upon opening bacteria would get in and destroy the insects. These are priceless collections. The whole satisfaction is that the present staff treated Tulu with great respect and talked about organizing a large exhibition of insects with a portrait of Tulu. In addition to these cases, there are also plants collected by Tulu in the museum. There are about two thousand. The current staff write to us and asked Tulu who was the founder of the Museum — of course it was Prof. Mączak, murdered by the Germans, and not Mr Cynkałowski, who claims to be the founder.
I cried my eyes out during our stay in Krzemieniec. I like Krzemieniec very much. Two of our children were born there; Babcia’s grave is there. Lila was born in Żołkiew, which is now renamed to “Niesterow.” Everyone there welcomed us as guests; even Mrs Turkowa, a rabid Ukrainian, gave us a jar of honey, but what of it, when everyone is waiting for the Germans. For me all this gave the impression as if I were staying in a grave. At moments it seemed to me that I could smell corpses, and everywhere it was dirty, ugly. Our relatives live in old, musty houses. Stare Brody is one ruin, the roads rutted, holes, mud, dust. The trees cut down. Not a trace of Babcia’s little house. In general people there build very little, and those new buildings are such rigged-up little houses, without fences. The shops, dirty, pitiful. People very badly dressed. Women neglected, obese. The trees cut down. Krzemieniec is, outwardly, relatively little damaged and clean, because it owes this to scholarly congresses. Cemeteries overgrown — sinking in nettles, plaques torn off Polish graves. There are no Greek-Catholic churches; there are only Orthodox churches, and only old women go to them. Working people and youth are not allowed to go to church. The Catholic church in Brody has been turned into a physical education school. The lyceum church in Krzemieniec is boarded up. The Catholic parish church is open once a month. The monastery in Podkamień has been turned into a home for the insane. In Podkamień on the roads lie smashed beautiful statues of saints. The buses dirty, rickety. The eateries disgusting. In the shops you can get anything of value only for a bribe. I didn’t believe Tulu when he told of grain drying on the highways, until I saw it with my own eyes. Everyone drinks vodka. Divorces are an everyday matter. I know that the present government on those lands doesn’t care, but if the Ukrainians were more cultured it wouldn’t be like that. I don’t want to go there anymore. Tulu is drawn there, but let him go alone.
Our escape from Krzemieniec.
At the “farm” we left Maria Unoldowa. She too fled soon after us, and the farm was taken over by Gena Majkowa. What happened to the furniture—I don’t know, and there was quite a lot of it, because three rooms were furnished. We loaded part of the bedding, dishes, and books into crates and trunks and left them with neighbors “for safekeeping.” We had to flee—around Krzemieniec the Ukrainian blackness [mob]. In Krzemieniec, Germans raging. Tulu’s Polish co-workers were being picked over like peas [hunted down one by one] by the Germans. Any day Tulu might not return home from the museum. The children had long been asking me for a kitten. Downstairs in the basement lived a woman. Her cat had lovely kittens. I got one—beautiful gray. We named him Szaruś. The children didn’t want to leave the kitten in Krzemieniec and took him with them. Everyone later talked about the cat fleeing with us. Before that we collected information, addresses needed during the escape. We had very little cash, because the Ukrainians didn’t want to buy, knowing we wouldn’t take our belongings with us anyway; besides, those hyenas had plenty after the Jews. We took with us the remnants of clothes, some bedding. Tulu took a lot of his gear, like a microscope, some special mirror, tweezers, and so on. Now Tulu says he took it unnecessarily, but then it was hard for him to part with it. The most important things were the documents and photographs. I took the kettle my mother bought me when I went to my position, and which still serves us to this day. We hired a cart and loaded our “property.” The children also got on it with the kitten and a toy monkey; we with Tulu went on foot into the unknown, terrifying. We did not receive permission to leave, but at the railway station we got on the train as “fare-dodgers.” In the same compartment sat some Germans, but they pretended not to see us. That’s how we got to Dubno. We hauled out our bundles and set up camp in the waiting room. Supposedly some railwayman there was to place us in a train bound for Brody, where Tulu’s brother—Aldek, working on the railway at that time—was waiting for us, but here one train after another kept leaving and we sat at the station. Tulu fainted. When I revived him, we put our heads together and Tulu went to the railwaymen and showed them a gold five-ruble coin—it helped. They shoved us into a train, but what of it when in Radziwiłłów they told us to get off. It was the border station between the so-called Ukraine and the General Government. The next station was already Brody, and in it Aldek. The station was empty and we alone with a mountain of bundles and the children in the middle. A Polish railwayman came up to us and advised us to leave the platform quickly, because when the shift came—and those were Ukrainians—we’d be done for. We dragged the bundles and the children as best we could to the nearest house. We were lucky, because it was the house of a Polish railwayman. He installed us in a room from which that same day they had carried the body to the cemetery of that railwayman’s son, murdered by Ukrainians. Well into the afternoon a railwayman from Brody appeared and took Lila and Otuś into a freight train to a trackman’s hut. He locked them in, and I was terribly afraid of that separation. The children arrived safely; Aldek took them, who supposedly cried when he saw them. We stayed alone with Ania in Radziwiłłów because our hosts weren’t there. Suddenly toward evening we heard shooting, very close. We lay down on the floor under the windows and waited. Suddenly someone began banging at the windows; we were terribly frightened because we thought they were bandits, until we heard a voice: Mr Duda—please open up. That young, tall railwayman had come especially for us. He scooped Ania up in his arms, and we only the suitcase with documents and photographs, and we ran after him to the locomotive waiting for us. On the tracks a German stopped us for a moment, but that railwayman answered briskly that he was saving us from bandits, and thus we reached the engine. They had come deliberately for us; reportedly that railwayman ferried many families to the General Government for evacuation and himself was killed. We got off at night before the station and went to the agreed house to sleep. In the morning we went to Aldek’s, where Lila and Otuś were already waiting for us. Seemingly safe yet poor, homeless, helpless. All our belongings stayed in Radziwiłłów, and only later that railwayman, moving to Brody, transported our “treasures” as well. We obtained, for a fee, “fake” Kennkarten (equivalents of an identity card), and we waited for Nusia, who was to come for us from Zmigrod. When Nusia saw us, she was disappointed, because she thought that after all the professor’s family would arrive, and here we were with Tulu—skinny, blackened, dressed “Lord have mercy,” and three wretched children. We walked for the last time in the garden at old Brody, we slept under Tulu’s family roof. In that little house Otuś had been christened during vacation. To that little house I used to come in my maiden days and later as a married woman; in that little house Lila stayed for a time under Babcia’s care. In that little house Ania was for the first and last time. We ate fruit from the trees that Tulu had planted. The little house was charming. It had a little porch overgrown with vines, a vestibule from which one entered a room and a little kitchen on the right, and on the left there were two little rooms, those cubbyholes separated by a thin wall not reaching the ceiling. Wooden floors, clean and yellow, white walls. In the garden lilacs, acacias, ashes, fruit trees, and lots of flowers. We had to say goodbye to the Aldeks (they had three sons then), to the little house, and go on—to Zmigrod near Jasło. The journey was awful. In Lwów, in Podzamcze, we waited a long time, and the stench of burned bodies reached the train. In the train an incredible crush; the children stood the whole time on the benches behind people’s backs. In their arms they held the kitten, who struggled to get away. With difficulty we reached Jasło, and from there by some truck to Zmigrod. Auntie’s little flat was clean, cozy, peaceful, but unfortunately Julek—Nusia’s husband—was already sick with tuberculosis then. Tuberculosis had already taken over his whole organism; he could no longer walk because his legs were ill too. Staying with Nusia then was Julek’s sister, Zosia Mrożkowa—the mother of the later famous writer Mrożek. I remember that for supper there were knedle ziemniaczane. I don’t remember after how many days; I think already the next day we moved to “our own.” It was a single room in a post-Jewish house. Besides us there were two more families living there, the Przewłockis and the Brożynas. They had two-room flats. Mrs Przewłocka came from Zmigrod and they even had a bit of their own field. The Przewłockis were refugees. Mrs Przewłocka worked at the dairy. Przewłocki wrote poems. The Brożynas had a little daughter, Halinka, and the Przewłockis had a little ward, Janeczka, sickly and very inappropriately dressed and raised; when the front came through, that child died. Tulu also worked at the dairy, and then it was a food paradise. There was plenty of milk; we got cream and butter, there was bread and even meat. Nusia gave us some fabrics from which I sewed coats for Ania and Lila; I even outfitted Otuś and Kazik Unold (he was with us too) from old clothes. I also sewed myself as many as two dresses. In a word, a paradise compared to Krzemieniec. I remember my first trip to the seamstress, who lived outside Zmigrod. I had to force myself to take that walk, because in Krzemieniec it had been impossible due to the Ukrainian bands. Right before our flight from Krzemieniec we slept with axes under the beds in order to defend ourselves in case of an attack. Not far from us they had already murdered our acquaintance Górecki. Our “furniture” in Zmigrod was mostly from sawmill offcuts, nailed together by Tulu. There were two “daybeds” and a cupboard of boards, and Nusia lent us 1 iron bed, a table, a small cabinet, and a few chairs. It was not much larger, or maybe the same, as our present room. One daybed was carried out into the vestibule during the day. Kazik U. slept on it. He was supposed to be at Nusia’s, but I took him to us because the sick Jurek needed peace, and Kazek was terribly talkative; secondly, I didn’t want the starved, emaciated boy to be in contact with a consumptive. On the shelves, as always where Tulu is, there were already stacks of newspapers. We lit a lamp. In the evenings we sat at the table; the cat strolled under our chins or along our shoulders. I, as usual, didn’t idle; I often cooked dinners at Nusia’s, helped her wash and clean; at our place there was also the need to scrub the floor, cook, etc. I taught Bogna and Otuś, and Lila even had a few piano lessons and went to school. I also traveled to Jasło with butter for the Germans; on that occasion I always carried something to trade, most often veal, cream, butter (that was Nusia’s merchandise), but also enough for us that for that merchandise the dentist repaired my and Lila’s teeth. These were dangerous trips, because often at the entry to Jasło the Germans searched us. For that purpose I took Lila and hid the goods under the seat; in the back there were crates of butter for the warehouse. Nusia always awaited our return with fear. Tulu often took the children for walks—they collected ćereń [cornelian cherry], from which I made excellent syrup. Otuś fell ill again with pneumonia, but as usual came out of it safely. The nightmare was Julek’s illness. Nusia, as they say, “stood on her head” to save him, but implacable tuberculosis was devouring him. He was a very handsome fellow, he was a teacher, but even before the war Father brought him into the dairy (it was their own). When the war broke out, Nusia and Julek took a post in Zmigrod, and Julek’s parents stayed in Bożęcin. Kazik U. was in Zmigrod until First Communion, and he was Lila’s peer. That idyll did not last long— from the east the front was approaching. The Germans were having fits of fury. Armia Krajowa (A-K) had its hands full. Almost the entire Żmigrod intelligentsia belonged to the AK. By day they worked, at night they went on actions, and now the Germans ordered trenches to be dug. I, on account of the small children, was exempt from this. Tulu, as a dairy employee, too. Some traitor betrayed the AK men. The Gestapo carried out a roundup on them. The front was already close—a “theater” was coming to Zmigrod; the “actresses” lodged in private homes. One of them lived at the Brożynas’, who belonged to the AK. Just in case, he cut out some earth under the floor to hide in the event of a search. The night was sultry; we slept with the window open. Suddenly I hear: “Das Fenster zumachen, aber schnell.” I closed the window, and the Gestapo were already pounding at the hallway door. Przewłocki opened for them, and the Germans straight to us. They shone flashlights, saw Tulu in bed and said, “Gut, gut, der Mann ist zu Hause,” and pulled out a list of the condemned. They asked for Tulu’s name, which however did not appear on their list. They did a search anyway and ordered Tulu to get dressed and took him to the Brożynas’. On hearing the rumpus at our place and in the hallway, Brożyna leapt into the little pit that was in the corner of the kitchen. In that spot stood a table covered with a cloth. The Germans slapped the “actress” across the face for not having watched over Brożyna—they were simply raging. They ordered Tulu and Przewłocki to shift a pile of coal in the cellar. They jabbed bayonets into every bundle of straw in the attic. Brożyna vanished, and the house had already been under observation since dusk. They took Tulu and Przewłocki and ordered them to lead them to the indicated addresses. Tulu knew who was meant, but luckily wriggled out of it, saying that he was a stranger, that he knew no one, and led them to a house that was not on the list. They beat Tulu and told him to go home; Tulu came drenched in sweat, because until the last moment he was sure they would kill him. My reaction was unceasing screaming. The Germans sprang at me and hushed me like a witch, and I certainly looked that way, because I was in a black slip and my hair was disheveled. The next day they told me that with that screaming I had alarmed the neighboring houses and the suspects fled. When they took Tulu I was already sure I would never see him again. The Germans took Brożyna’s wife and said that if her husband did not report by morning, they would kill her. Tulu and Przewłocki were gone—I was left alone with the children and little Halinka Brożynówna. The Germans ordered the light left on and burst into the house every moment together with the “actress.” Little Halinka had a cradle fastened to the floor—I had to sit by her and rock her. After some time I heard from the pit in the kitchen the voice of Brożyna, who asked me to hand over clothes, because he was only in his shirt. Brożyna’s clothes were lying in the kitchen, but I handed him another set from the wardrobe. Near dawn Tulu came—enormous relief. I told him about Brożyna. In the morning the wailing family rushed in and took Halinka, but I told them nothing about Brożyna. Only when the guard left from under the house did I pass him breakfast under the table and some cigarettes, and Brożyna escaped through the gardens to the forest. Brożyna’s wife and several other hostages were assigned to the front to kitchens—after some time they began to pester the soldiers, and they all returned home. Then came the attempt on Hitler. German troops were marching through Zmigród—I stood in the doorway, and the soldiers waved their hands to me and shouted, “Matka! das Krüg ist cu ende.” Unfortunately for us, that was only when the “Krüg” [Krieg] began. During this roundup they took several people from Zmigrod and shot them. The front was approaching—when the houses began to shake from the explosions, then we did the biggest foolish thing with Nusia. We took the most valuable things, the sick Julek, and the children and went to Kąty (closer to the Dukla Pass), right on the Wisłoka, hoping the front would bypass us, and it was quite the opposite.
Kąty
We arrived one beautiful September day in Kąty. Sun, fruit on the trees. We set up our “camp” at an acquaintance’s farm—Wokurki, in a new house under the hill. Ciocia Nusia drove us there and turned back to Zmigrod to save and secure property. Meanwhile the front suddenly drew near and took Kąty into its range. Part of the inhabitants, along with their cattle, took shelter in the woods, part in vaulted cellars. We spread kilims on the floor and lay down on them “like a pancake”: the sick Julek, his six-year-old daughter Bogna, Tulu, me, Lila, Otuś and Ania. Our hosts fled to the forest. The house trembles from exploding shells, plaster falls from the walls and dusts us, the room is white with it. Out of the blue a first Soviet soldier walks into the house, opens a window, sets up a machine gun in it and fires. I beg him to leave this house because there are children and a gravely ill man here. It did no good. He advised us to leave the house, but how—Julek was on crutches, little children, and outside bullets were whistling thickly. Where to go?! The woods were too far, we didn’t know how far to any cellar. (The cellars were separate, almost completely dug into the ground, only their rounded roofs stuck up above it.) With a heavy heart we left Julek (at his urgent pleading), the children put on their little coats, we gathered only a suitcase with documents and literally between bullets we crept, ran, wanting to reach some cellar. We came upon perhaps two and no one took us in. Under the little roof of one cellar stood a peasant; magnanimously, he advised us to get under the root hollow of trees by the Wisłoka. Indeed, tall trees grow along the Wisłoka, we scurried down the steep bank and nestled into a cavity under the roots. Above us were the Bolsheviks; on the opposite bank of the Wisłoka, the Germans. Fighting! Bullets splashed right at our feet as they hit the water. At one point a figure of a German with a rifle ready to fire emerged from behind the corner of a house on the other side of the Wisłoka. I went numb because he was aiming in our direction. Perhaps he realized they were civilians with children—we stayed alive. We sat under that root cavity almost until dusk. In the meantime Tulu “visited” Julek twice. Although the house was left without windows, Julek survived. Toward evening we got into acquaintances’ cellar. It was tiny; along one wall stood chests with the owners’ clothes and bedding. We lined the free half with kilims. Two thirds of the little cellar was a single bed on which at times 13–14 people slept side by side. Apart from the small children, no one could straighten their legs. Poor, tall, sick Julek! The little cellar, especially at night, shook to its foundations; heavy tanks drove right past the door. If a grenade had hit the roof, we would all have been buried. In the morning it was quieter. Then we came out of the little cellar. Both of us, with Nusia, combed and washed the children. We cooked in the cottage, on the sly and in a hurry we peeled potatoes and even ground grain on the quern-stones. We had fat in the form of rendered butter. Just before the offensive I bought a little piglet; naturally it stayed in Zmigrod, but our acquaintance Jan Nowak (he is now a judge) killed it and brought us half to Kąty. We cooked “ein Topf,” and only Julek ate separately; the rest of us from one pot. Kąty went back into German hands. The village was strewn with soldiers’ corpses. Tulu had to bury them. In the neighboring house there was a so-called “Szreibsztuba.” The Germans drove any civilians they caught to build a bridge that Soviet planes bombed. Tulu was driven there several times. The Germans were catching chickens all over Kąty and made Nusia and me pluck them. One time I started griping, calling the Germans Szwabs [Swabians] and so on. One of them, who was dozing with his back propped against the kitchen table, understood Polish, sprang at me with a revolver—I bolted for the cellar—the German after me, only Tulu blocked his way and began to excuse me—it worked, because the German waved his hand and walked off. Among the Germans milling about there were also cultured ones, even with a heart. Am I not overdoing it with that “heart”? But fact is fact—one of those Germans almost every day took Ania in his arms, carried her to the supply truck and loaded her up with either sugar or some canned goods. The front dragged on; for us it was ages. We decided to get out of Kąty. But how? It was far to the point from which one could leave the front by military vehicle, especially for sick, limping Julek, and on top of that there were small children and some belongings. Nusia found out that the German on whom our fate depended was celebrating his name day or birthday. She gathered some autumn flowers from neighboring gardens and went to offer congratulations. She came back with a promise that they would take us out of Kąty; only we had to reach the point on our own. On foot was impossible because Julek was lame, small children, belongings. Some means of transport depended on the commander of the “Szreibsztube.” I was the one who had to procure that wagon. I went to the German and he started making advances—luckily a frontline soldier came to report in and that saved me. We got the wagon. We loaded it with our belongings, seated the sick Julek and little Anusia on it, Lila, Otuś and Bogna clung to the back of the wagon and rode standing up. We hadn’t gone far when the Soviets began to rake the road with a hurricane of fire. It was hell. We grabbed Ania, helped Julek down in a flash and took shelter in the nearest cellar. Meanwhile our carter drove the horses with our belongings to the vehicle departure point. Again, a horrible problem—how to get there with sick Julek and small children. Not far away there was an improvised dressing station. We went there with Nusia. The chief doctor, furious, was living essentially on black coffee and cigarettes because he was continuously performing amputations on wounded Germans. Somehow we implored someone from the auxiliary personnel and they gave us an ambulance in which Julek arrived. The children and we went on foot. Our things were piled in an empty barn—again, an attack. Lila and Otuś were in the barn then and its tiles were showering down onto the yard. Naturally we came out of that unscathed too, but to finish us off, a heavy rain began to pour; mud up to the ankles, and through that mud we carried our belongings to the truck waiting for us. As the children scrambled under the truck’s tarp, a puddle literally formed around each of them. Not one of the children, nor even we, so much as sneezed. At last we drove beyond the front line—it felt almost foolish in that silence. They delivered us late at night to some locality and we found ourselves in an empty room with straw and hay on the floor. The Germans who were sitting in the rooms beyond gave us hot black coffee and we lay down to sleep side by side. In the morning we set out further. The driver was a bit tipsy and wanted to take us right to the house in Turza near Gorlice. In that house lived Julek’s brother, a teacher in Turza. Right before our destination this ride could have ended tragically. The road was slippery, clayey, climbing uphill, with steep drops on the left and right, the so-called “paryje” [ravines]. The truck was right above the precipice when Ania let out a terrible scream and the hapless driver cut the engine. We got out carefully so the truck wouldn’t tip over, and partly on foot, partly on a wagon brought by Kazik Kędzior, we reached our destination. Nusia, with Julek and Bogna, moved into a tiny room at Kazik’s, and we stayed nearby with a widow.
Stay in Turza.
Aunt Nusia did what she could to get food and nursed her sick husband. We were healthy, but each day was very hard to get through. I bartered the last rags for food, I went to dig potatoes, Tulu went to the forest for firewood. The digging was hard work for me. The peasants gathered and took turns organizing the potato harvest. They were well-fed and strong compared to me, and I wanted to hold my head high and kept up with them as best I could. For a day’s work I got two meals and a basket of potatoes. The women saw it was hard for me and then would leave me in the kitchen, where I cooked a hearty supper for on average 15–20 people. Our landlady and her sons were lice-ridden, and lice didn’t spare us either. The village was relatively well-off, and despite the requisitions people did not go hungry. Lila started going to school in Turza. When the teacher asked the children what each had eaten for breakfast—Lila said “dziama,” because that’s what the mixture was called there. All the children laughed at Lila. We had no help from anywhere. I felt I wouldn’t last long in Turza. One day I went to Sącz to reconnoiter. I rode a freight train in the booth with a railwayman, and again there were amorous advances, which I barely wriggled out of. It was probably after some 10–12 years that I came to Sącz again. I cried and laughed by turns as I walked the streets. I went to our “street.” “Our” house was standing. I walked in to strangers in “our” apartment. It was something like a “Fata Morgana” in the desert. An elusive mirage. Then I went to Zawada near N. Sącz, where to this day relatives of my Father live: the Zarębas and the Kumors; they told us they would take us in. I don’t remember how I got from N. Sącz to Gorlice, from where I walked to Turza (about 10 km). When I got to Turza I went to the sołtys to ask for a wagon. He wouldn’t give one. He explained that if we didn’t leave they would have to support us, because we had nothing left, and we probably wouldn’t die of hunger and cold. He still wouldn’t, and yet most peasants—and Turza is a big village—had horses. The sołtys magnanimously advised us to go along with the Germans who would come here for hay. We had no other way out, and at the appointed time we pulled up with our landlady’s wagon (the wagon was pulled by cows) to the sołtys’s house. We were there around 11, and we left after dark. At the sołtys’s there was the smell of scrambled eggs frying, there was bread and milk on the table, and we set off on dry bread. The Germans loaded two wagons with hay “up to the ceiling.” At the bottom of one they put our things (a kilim, a bit of bedding, photographs, documents, and the remnants of clothes). On the [other] we barely “wystyrmali” ourselves [managed to perch], and, lurching, set off on the road. The Germans, probably by order, sang the Polish anthem almost the whole way, naturally mangling it badly—they were losing and therefore were becoming “Polish patriots.” We arrived around midnight in Gorlice. The Germans unloaded the hay elsewhere, and our “property” remained there too. We stayed with the Germans at quarters. They treated us to hot coffee and bread. In the morning we started looking around for a means of transport to Sącz. The railway was out because we didn’t get a pass. We stood a long time on the road until one German agreed to go for the children and our things and take us to N. Sącz. We had remnants of vodka and bacon and promised them to the driver. We arrived in Sącz—we got out at the market—the German looked at us and didn’t take payment. I went to Mrs Doroszukowa on Różana Street No. 3. Unfortunately she wasn’t home; the children, locked in, were looking out the window onto the balcony. While waiting for Mrs Doroszukowa we went down to the cobbler who had his workshop on the ground floor. Exhausted to the last limits, I told him a few bitter words of truth about some Poles. This great patriot took offense and didn’t offer us even water. Mrs Doroszukowa arrived, fed us with “czem chata bogata” [whatever the house could afford], and she was living in poverty. We spent one night, and in the morning I went to Zawada, from where I came back with a wagon and took the family to the relatives.
Zawada.
We first lived with the Kumors. They were a childless couple. They were raising Mietek Fręczek, whose mother—the sister of Kumorowa—died when Mietek was still a little boy. Kumorowa is a Zarębianka by birth—the daughter of my father’s sister. Kumor is an old, conceited man. He treated us like intruders—who disturbed his peace. They had three rooms; they gave us the smallest little room right by the kitchen, without a stove. At first we ate together; the fare was very simple, but that was nothing—we liked everything. Worse was that Kumor wanted to get rid of us. On the opposite side of the road lived Józef and Maria Zaręba. Józef too is the son of my father’s sister. They had as many as 9 children. They were relatively well-off because they had 25 morgs of land and a piece of forest, but they had been terribly depleted by the war. They were, however, much more warmhearted, unlike Kumor, who moreover was the wójt and could really have helped us. The Zarębas whitewashed a room for us, lent us two beds, a trestle table, a bench, and two folding chairs, and once again we had our own “home.” I tried to obtain food as much as possible on my own—Kumor looked down on us. He did not believe that Tulu had been a professor at the Krzemieniec Lyceum, and I a teacher. Once I baked cookies with saccharin, made tea, and invited Kumor. On that occasion I showed him our diplomas; the youngest, five-year-old Ania, gave him a reading of a newspaper [i.e., demonstrated reading], and we rather impressed Mr wójt. He arranged a larger flour ration for us, and wooden clogs for Tulu. Kumorowa gave us 1 liter of splendid milk (for 5 people). I went to the cellars for potatoes as if they were my own. Christmas was wonderful because there was ample bread, there was even a roll, and a bit of meat in the form of a chicken earned by me. The Christmas tree was decorated with cubes of sugar in little paper wrappings. I was at the name day of yet another Zarębianka, Ludmiła; that too was a childless marriage, also “oak-like” [‘zdebowate’—stiff, formal], but at her place I ate my fill of sausage and cake and got tipsy on samogon. To repay the Zarębas, the kindest of all these relatives, I taught two of their children, Hanka and Józek, to read and write (now Hanka has finished vocational training in dressmaking, married, has a beautiful house and 3 children. Józek is preparing for his master’s exam in part-time studies). Along with teaching the Zarębas, two children of the neighbors also came to the lessons, and Ania was learning too. All this lasted not quite 3 months, because in January 1945 (exactly on January 20). Just a few days earlier some German unit had arrived at Zawada and carried over to the Kumors a whole slaughtered piglet. They didn’t manage to eat it; they had to flee. Kumorowa called me to “dress” it. It was the first time in my life I dealt with such a job. I took Tulu’s razor and shaved the piglet with it, and then they helped me split it. I got a whole half from the Kumors. I gave a quarter to the Zarębas, and a quarter remained for us. It was a splendid feast. Night came, the bullets again whistled across the yard like swallows. I had to go to the well for water, and literally right by my ear a bullet whizzed past. We piled into the cellar with the Zarębas, but we sat it out there only one night. I couldn’t sit still and kept going out of the cellar and watching the fighting. Zawada is on the hilltop. Below, N. Sącz [Nowy Sącz]; the sky was dark navy, densely lit by shells. One terrible nightmare—the Germans—left. In the morning Bolshevik units entered Zawada. At the Zarębas’ and the Kumors’ there were swarms of them. They literally stole things out of people’s hands and raped women. Because I spoke Ukrainian I often had to intervene in various matters at the neighbors’. At the Kumors’ the captain himself took up quarters, which made Kumor immensely proud. He was given the best room, in which there was a chest of drawers, and in it, locked in a drawer, two gold wedding rings, a gold chain, and a large gold pocket watch. The “gentleman” captain had to go on toward Berlin, but before that he pried up the top of the chest and took all the gold “as a keepsake.” There was an innumerable number of such various thefts. During the hostilities the beautiful Sącz castle was blown up. The castle was blown up on orders of the Bolshevik troops, quite needlessly. In my youth various celebrations were held in the castle courtyard. In the halls they held exhibitions of paintings by such painters as Reguła, or the excellent portraitist Barbacki (he was killed by the Germans as a hostage). In the little woods surrounding the castle I gathered honey mushrooms and russulas. The Germans blew up the bridge over the Dunajec. The end of the bridge where I had walked with my dad as a child and later with girlfriends, and with Tulu as my fiancé. I saw from the bank how the Soviets were laying a pontoon bridge. The winter was mild, the water high and turbid. A soldier fell in before my eyes and drowned, and no one tried to save him. In a short time they “patched” and pieced together the old bridge, and in that state it had to serve people for several more years. After it was dismantled its parts were taken to Opole, and there it continues to serve people. For us very normal times had already arrived. Tulu began teaching already in January. He walked on foot from Zawada in wooden clogs; often his entire day’s food was a plate of “dziama” [a mush/porridge] with milk. Instruction took place in various houses all over the city; there were also classes in the tenement where before the war we had lived. Lila began to attend the 6th grade in Zawada, and Otuś the 2nd; Otuś had a nice navy-blue outfit (reworked from Tulu’s), and so I dressed him, to protect the clothes, in a “cobbler’s” smock, until Otuś rebelled and no longer wanted to go to school in a smock. In the spring the children spent whole days tearing around outdoors. Once Otuś and Ania fell into the manure pit. In Zawada too Ania and Otuś came down with whooping cough; Ania in particular went through it badly. I began to look for an apartment in the city. It was tremendously difficult. Marysia Korpińska (an old friend of ours from the same street) advised me that at Helena Chełmiecka 3 there was a post-Jewish little house in which people from Poznań were living, and they were returning to their parts. I went to the Housing Office and they assigned it to us. Unfortunately in the meantime Mrs Sekułowa quickly moved into it with her three sons and did not want to budge. I asked at the town hall to be assigned some other apartment, but they said they would bring charges against that lady and she would have to move out. The case went to court and Mrs Sekułowa received an order to move out. (She had a sister on the same street, Mrs Cieślowa, and she had an apartment with her), but that didn’t help, and Tulu walked kilometers every day from Zawada. I hit on a “brilliant” idea, loaded our belongings onto a cart, and we moved into half the little house through the window (the house had three little rooms and a kitchen). Only then did Mrs Sekułowa move to her sister’s apartment, and later to a beautiful apartment in the commune.
Chełmiecka 3.
It was a little house made up of 3 small rooms, a kitchen, and a large veranda. It also had a little garden plot. Tulu taught—I out of necessity only kept house—because the teaching post they offered me was far away in the village; in Sącz they didn’t want to give me one. It was hard in every respect, financially and in terms of every convenience. Water was far away, lighting was by kerosene. In the apartment the “furniture” consisted of two beds from Zawada (each different); I borrowed [another] simple wooden bed from an old classmate and that was the “bedroom”; the iron one stood in the second little room. There was trouble with the bedticks because one had to go all the way to Zawada for straw. The “etagères” were made from UNRRA boxes (these were packages sent by the USA for the starving population), precisely “United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration,” an international organization created in the USA in 1943 under the slogan of providing economic assistance to the populations of countries destroyed by war, dissolved in 1947. The curtains hung on strings. The second room had an iron bed, a huge table from the Jesuit boarding school and chairs that the pupils carried over for us, along with two nightstands. Tulu somehow procured at school a huge wardrobe, which served us both as a clothes closet and partly as a pantry. Tulu and I whitewashed the apartment ourselves (later every year Hania came from Zawada, or Józia the lame’s mother—Przybyłowa). The garden was important, with two apple trees; I bought some 2 bushes of “smorodyn” [currants]. I was very happy with that garden and put a lot of work into it. Tutu earned little. I walked to Zawada for potatoes. They never brought even a measure to us, perhaps later when we were buying 3–6 m. for the winter [probably cubic metres (of wood)] and 2–3 kop of cabbage [unit of 60]. I dug those potatoes myself for free, and of course loaded myself with them like a horse—a backpack completely full and two bags—and walked with that 6 km one way. Often I literally had nothing to give the children for supper and then I remember on the long June days we would just go to bed. I gave private lessons. Various mothers also came asking for influence with Tulu. They wanted to give something—I made excuses, and in my heart I asked God that they would insist and leave the present. Queues for food were like a continuation of the war; it was a plague. They allotted 1 kg, sometimes even ½ kg of sugar or flour, and you stand for hours in line for that! The children didn’t want to stand. I was often pushed out of the queue—I had to argue, and our children were cross with me because of it. When they started rationing food with cards it was a bit better, but there was too little of it to avoid standing in queues altogether. With clothing—a nightmare. Marysia Korpińska worked with American relief and about 3 times brought a few clothes in a handbag. Sometimes Auntie Hela (she worked in Kudowa and her eldest son Kazik went to our lycée and then all three boys were with us) sent some “ciuchy,” German castoffs, and that’s how we managed, but step by step it got better and better. We were with the children about 2 times in Kudowa at Hela’s, who, compared to us, had a beautiful apartment—it was hard to want to return from her place to our junk. I had very frequent headaches; in general in the afternoons I felt like “peas by the path” [idiom: completely spent]. Otuś probably worried about this the most and sometimes late at night brought me headache powders from the neighbors. These were probably all aftereffects of wartime experiences and hard work. When the gate creaked, I would freeze in terror. The displaced doctor Isterewicz told me to lie flat, measure my pulse, and take some medications. That whole “affair” was before Easter; I then directed the children from bed—Lila kneaded and baked the cake. I rested—I came out of it—and often afterwards it seemed to me there was no job I couldn’t handle. And there was plenty of that work, because already on Chełmiecka Street, almost without a break, besides our children there were at first Hela’s 2 boys and later three. Naturally neither a washing machine, nor water, nor light. To make ends meet somehow I leased a piece of field from Bastowa—our milkwoman. The stay was diversified by Hela’s arrivals—first with the children and later to the children. I remember that for one holiday I started early to lay in flour and sugar and then I baked cakes with 30 kg of flour. It was not much at all for 6 children. Iwonka was only born on 30-X 1949. I sewed coats for the girls, or rather for Lila, out of blankets. One Christmas Eve we had borscht with soap. In winter the kitchen was run in one room. A makeshift iron stove, one table the children sat around, a kerosene lamp, dark. In haste I set the ladle down on the soap, which stuck to it and fell into the borscht. There was always a lot of fish for the holidays—the cheapest “dunajcówka” [fish from the Dunajec]. For the Wigilia we sat on a bench, on the bed, on two chairs, on boxes. Tulu would take out several of his tweezers for pulling bones from the fish. There was always kutia and apple strudel.
The children helped me a lot—there were weekly shifts; the older ones also had to carry water, light the stove, sweep, run errands.
On 30-X-1948, Iwonka was born. Maybe it was a reaction after the war, or maybe self-defense against approaching old age—enough to say that I was very happy at Iwonka’s birth. I searched out her names in the calendar. The whole family knew there would be a baby at our place. There was a solemn christening. Hela became the godmother and Olek the godfather—my siblings. The children went to school, left for holidays, I stayed home alone. The aunts found her name, “Iwonka,” and that’s what we called her and call her to this day. Only when registering her for school did I learn what Tulu had really given as her name: Urszula–Elżbieta. That is Tulu’s beloved “Koszulka,” as Tulu called her. Before Iwonka’s birth we often walked together to the Chełmiec forest, or to Klimkówka—to the forests of my youth. I love orchids immensely, and when I saw them for the first time after the war in the Sącz forest I actually screamed with joy. We went to Rytro, Głębokie. Those are also places I used to go already in childhood. It was hard, there was a great deal of work, but the house was pleasant, the little street quiet. We kept dogs; first there was “Ksenia.” The children were on their way to the library and burst into the house with a scream that Ksenia was dead. They cried terribly—a Soviet car had run her over. The second dog was a splendid German shepherd—Reks. He went bathing with us, went on walks. The end of the idyll came when our house was bought by the hairdresser Jurkowski. Some Jew, an heir, turned up and sold the house. From that moment Jurkowski kept visiting us. He tore down [came to pick] apples, piled junk in the yard. He “repaired” the roof, until finally he gave poison to the dog. We tried to save him. We went with him to the vet, made him drink milk, and the dog recovered. But not for long, because when he did for him a second time nothing helped anymore. That Jurkowski is worse than a beast. Then he kept coming to us so that we would exchange apartments with him. He tormented us so much that we finally decided to. We gave him a cultivated garden, a clean apartment, and he [gave] an apartment infested with bedbugs, and a horrible yard because Jurkowski kept pigs and a cow. That yard was one single manure heap. Work in the garden simply carried me away. We covered the manure heap, dug up the entire yard and the garden in front of the house. At first we had all vegetables in abundance, later there was less because the sycamore maple spread and the big apple trees grew and shaded part of the garden. There were so many flowers that when there was no money for bread Olek and Alek went to the market and sold them. Still, the financial situation was hard, and that’s why I bought small piglets, raised them .... in the .... cellar, and after some time I called the butcher. Kazik and Lila were already at university. When you turned a piglet into kiszki and kiełbasa, both we and the children in Kraków had something to eat. Just when Iwonka was 6, we let ourselves be tempted one more time by a dog. It was a little German shepherd, like a ball. He grew up together with the children, was their favorite, and Iwonka doted on him especially. Tragedy struck him already at the current apartment. They poisoned him. I went on a trip with Tulu and Iwonka was home alone; she took it terribly hard. I don’t want any dog or cat anymore. Szaruś, that kitten from Krzemieniec, also died from poison. In general the Sącz people are bad—they threw us out of food queues and threw us out of two houses, they poisoned our dogs, they cut down that pretty little tree we had planted, they covered the flowers with sand.
Hela moved in with us permanently, together with furniture—I threw out those cobbled-together pieces of junk, and the home was passable at last, but the crampedness was terrible; in the first year on Helena there were 10 of us. In summer it was half bad because the little attic room rescued us, but winter was awful. And a chronic lack of money, because Hela at first worked as a quartermaster in a boarding school and earned very little. Tulu taught from morning till night (at times he had over 60 hours per week), but it was all too little, especially when autumn came, when you had to supply the house with fuel, potatoes, cabbage, shoes and coats for the children. Usually when I went to town across the bridge I cried, or I prayed to find some money or for someone from America to send us some. Lila and Kazek already at university, Olek finishing lycée, Radek and Ania catching up. I leased a field from Bastowa for potatoes and once I even sowed wheat, but I had a terrible lot of trouble with it. We washed and dyed old clothes with Hela and reworked them into new ones. At last we hit on an idea and started embroidering blouses, dresses, collars. Tulu helped us with this because he drew new patterns and transferred them. Lila had her part in this too. We sometimes embroidered through whole nights. So as not to fall asleep, in summer we embroidered by the open window and listened to the nightingales.
At last Hela moved to her own apartment, which she obtained with great difficulty. She took part of the furniture, and then we bought on installments a light dining-room set. I was terribly happy with it. Hela left the piano, but only temporarily—Iwonka played it, and a bit Ania, and even Lila when she came to Poland from England. Well, the time came for the piano too—because Kazek Unold took it. I felt sad, because since childhood my dream had been a piano. Violins wear on me when someone “saws” them. I like a violin orchestra. I love the piano immensely, only I can’t stand banging on the keys. I stood on my head and bought an old piano for 11,000 zł. That piano stands, because Iwonka is away from home, and when she comes she plays very little. Lila isn’t here. Nor is Otusia. Ania is far away. Iwonka is supposed to take the piano. Such was our happiness—our lot—that we could never warm a place for long anywhere, and the little house on Helena had to be left. That little house was cracked, the fissure was visible straight through, but Borus had his kennel there, there were those few beds of vegetables. Our landlord sold the house to Mrs Wróblówna. She bought it very cheaply and began persecuting us to move out. We submitted an application to the housing office; we didn’t want a private house, besides—to where? The housing commissions said we had sufficient floor space, we wrote piles of applications—in vain, and meanwhile Mrs Wróblówna first cut down that lovely sycamore I had planted, then covered the flowers in the garden with sand, tore away a piece of ceiling in the cellars, so that the floor in the room next to the kitchen lay only on the joists for, what, two big winters. The stoves smoked on top of that, I swept out soot twice a year. It was so cold in the apartment that in winter the water in the kitchen constantly froze. What were we to do?! Renovate? With what money? For whom? When Lila came with little Romuś (the second time), Mrs Wróblówna had a pit dug next to the house, supposedly to determine the state of the foundations—we feared lest Romuś fall into it. After Lila left, I hit on the idea not to whitewash the apartment, not to plug the gaps with plaster but with wadding. It looked awful. With difficulty I called in a sanitary commission in winter, which found those conditions inhuman, but again the regular housing commission ruled that all those “deficiencies” could be removed. “And round and round we go.” This tug-of-war disgusted me terribly!! Mrs Wróblówna was obliged to give us an apartment, but she was, in every sense of the word, A PIG. That wealthy, solitary woman. When at last they assigned us an apartment, she didn’t want to give a penny toward the deposit (6,000 zł), or for the move, or for the apple trees we had planted. We went very much into debt then, with the ZNP and with ORS (Obsługa Ratalnej Sprzedaży). If not for Tulu’s pupil, Furtek, the moving costs would have been added to that as well. There was a big problem with the piles of books, newspapers and other odds and ends that Tulu absolutely refused to part with, and the little flat had an area of 46 square meters plus a small cellar. I hit on the idea and, with my own money and with the management’s consent, I fenced off the storage under the stairs; now we have two little cellars; in one we packed the piles of books and newspapers, the other serves as a handy storeroom. Who and when will ever use those newspapers and old books? Water, a bathroom and radiators are marvelous things, but the surroundings are awful—a kolkhoz. Our block right in the very middle. There is no balcony—you can’t go an hour without curtains in the evening or in the day without sheers. Smoke from the boiler room pours between the blocks like through a chimney. Lawns trampled bare, children shouting. In the little house on Helena, when I embroidered at night by the open window I heard the nightingales sing. I long for greenery, for a garden bed; it wears me down on top of that that Tulu feels very bad, especially in winter when they stoke the boiler rooms and because of Biegonice. What a horrible mistake, a loss impossible to make good, those Biegonice. They built a factory of cathode electrodes there (distance some 4 km from Sącz). The beautiful Sącz Land, smoked over, gassed. They justify it by saying the main motive was to relieve unemployment, and what turned out?! Fewer than 2,000 people were employed. Unemployment still exists. They “evicted” hundreds of farmers, and the land fertile, beautiful. If instead of that factory they had built, for example, a holiday-tourism complex, how much greater the benefit would have been. I would blow that factory up. Flowers won’t grow in the apartment. Besides, our girls claim that potted plants warm the apartment. Personally, I would throw out half the junk and have metal grilles made, partition the apartment, and hang everything with flowers. I must get flower boxes to have flowers at least in summer. And how poor Borus felt! But at least the dog had us. We took him out for walks. I don’t want to describe how he died! Why don’t people understand that people can love a dog, a cat! Besides, these are Sącz people! I am ashamed I was born here. I have the impression that as they drove us out of houses and poisoned the animals, they would poison us too to have more space for themselves. Before we moved here, for close to two months I went every day and painted and cleaned the apartment. Now I keep moving the furniture around, because I want to bring a little variety into the prison. They will be bringing in gas and new expenses. Now, as I write this to Lili, gas is already installed; it cost about 10,000 zł. It is a convenience, but having it run in cost an enormous amount of health and energy, because the workmen botch, drink, and demand bribes.
I haven’t written anything about floods on Helena. We went through one flood on Chełmiecka. The water flooded the street, the garden, it only forced itself under the threshold. I took the children and went to a relative on “Paścią Górę.” That relative (he is no longer alive) was a forester. From there we watched the flood; there we ate splendid venison (I’d rather not think about the shot little doe). We went through two floods and several flood alerts at the second apartment, and since the little house had cellars, they were always flooded almost up to the ceilings. During one flood Ania didn’t manage to leave for her work placement because the water tore up the railway lines, and she returned home with a suitcase on her shoulder, wading along the little street almost up to her waist in water. The boys rode on the bathtub and the washtub down the street. When the water fell, you had to carry out tons of silt from the cellars. With us it still wasn’t so terribly bad. From the railway line I saw houses on the Dunajec inundated by the roaring, turbid water up to the roofs. Soldiers were carrying people out on pontoons. They waited to return to their homes at the gmina office, whose building stood by the main road (now there are private apartments there). With us too the Lupów family installed themselves. When it rained for several days in a row, there was already an alert. We brought up a supply of coal from below, carried all the wood upstairs. We lugged in from the well water for drinking, I bought bread and sugar, potatoes, and we waited for the flood. We would go out in raincoats to see how the water was rising in the Dunajec. In the house it was damp and “atmospheric.” Iwonka was very afraid and all night long asked how many inches the water had gone down, and it was just the opposite—the water was rising. Here there are no floods, but there is almost every day a flood of smoke.
People of Sącz.
There’s talk that in former times when the people of Sącz turned to the people of Stary Sącz (a small town 7 km from Sącz) with a request to borrow a gallows, they were refused, being told that they kept it for themselves and their children. That is the mentality of the people here in general. Right after the war I applied at the inspectorate for a job in Nowy Sącz. I was refused and offered posts in the countryside. Tulu taught in a liceum, the children went to a liceum, there was no public transport. The roads were awful. To live in the countryside with the younger children and run two households?! So I had to give up, and we had to live on Tulu’s meager pay alone. In Sącz it was only their own people who worked. Tulu probably wouldn’t have gotten a job either, but he had already started in January 1946, and there was a shortage of people with higher education.
Only thanks to strong patronage (our neighbor Janas was an inspector) did I get, in ’58, a job in Biczyce; it was a contract. Buses were already running; besides, I commuted by bicycle whenever I could. My zeal knew no bounds; I had longed for this work for years. I also studied on my own, because during the years of “unemployment” I had forgotten many things while doing the dirty work. In Biczyce I put on performances, excursions, I had good results, and that may have contributed to my getting a job in Chełmiec, this time a regular post. In Chełmiec it was sheer drudgery! Every year I painted benches, doors, windows, set up little gardens, aquariums, I bought teaching aids with my own money, especially for history. I staged performances (for one of them Lila, who happened to have come then from England, did the sets and costume designs for me). That performance even made it into the press. At the performance, or rather an enactment of the poetry of M. Konopnicka, old people cried, even the teachers. I read to the children Pan Tadeusz and Sienkiewicz “from cover to cover,” and at last I built a school. A school had to be built there sooner or later, but mainly my efforts sped the construction up by a good few years. Conditions there were terrible. The children were crammed into a former C K Austrian building at a crossroads. When cars drove by, the ceilings shook, until once there was a failure, with a total collapse of one ceiling threatening. They shut down our large classrooms upstairs and 2 on the ground floor. To get any additional rooms, we had to arrange a march with the children to the Pres. of the County Nat. Council; I argued, I was the initiator. They came rushing from the Party and finally gave us the keys to an old three-room granary. One classroom had only a single window. The children were going blind. I took photos of these “facilities” and, having faithfully described the conditions (the meeting with the authorities was held in the evening in the Remiza [firehouse], so no one would have bothered to come to the school anyway), I backed up my words with the photos I handed to the authorities. A pity I didn’t keep any for myself as a keepsake. After that meeting a School Construction Committee was formed, and I myself put forward my candidacy for secretary. The whole family helped me draft various papers. Otuś helped me a great deal; by virtue of serving as a referent in the spatial planning department, he knew the plans for the expansion of Chełmiec and so on. There were many opponents of building a new school; the various intrigues and adversities wouldn’t be recorded even on an oxhide, but at last the school’s construction was approved, and that same year they set about laying the foundations. Within a year a beautiful 12-room school was built. However, I was overcome with such disgust for those people that I transferred to N. Sącz. I got a job at Szkoła Podstawowa Nr 13 - Cwiczeń. It is a promotion, but there is also an enormous amount of work and very poor premises.
Since I am on this subject, I will add my retirement. It was not voluntary despite my 64 years. They forced me out, because I felt fine and the teaching profession is my life’s passion. Anticipating being dismissed, I submitted an application to the inspectorate and the kuratorium asking to keep me employed. Nothing helped. I am copying my application here.
Board of Education of the School District
of Kraków in Kraków.
On May 29, 1972, I received from the Department of Education in N. Sącz a letter notifying me that I was being retired.
Hereby I lodge an appeal from this decision for the following reasons:
I started copying out this petition and gave up. Forget it! They dismissed me, period. Just one more thing on this subject. As I fought like a lion against going into retirement, one of the teachers told me: "It's hard, age comes and one has to go. As soon as railwaymen hit 60 they must absolutely leave." I was outraged by such a comparison and said that when a writer hits 60 he's not allowed to write, a poet to create, a painter to paint.
I at least won this much, that despite a relatively short period—only 21 years of work—I received a pension not much smaller than Tula’s. Tula has 2,420 zł – I 2,379 zł. Perhaps now I'll still manage to devote time not so much to the children as at least to the grandchildren! The children and I! Lila was 6 years old, Otuś barely 2 when the war began. Ania was born at the beginning of the war, Iwonka a short time after the war, and my whole effort was aimed primarily not at upbringing but at keeping the children alive. When the situation finally began to improve, basically the children had already grown up and started leaving home one after the other. I had no time to raise them in an organized, considered way; besides, the children seemed to me such a part of me, simply my whole, that I often caught myself as if they had been with me since my earliest years, that they feel and think the way I do. My father inscribed in such a book of mine—a memory album—for example: "God gives to those who rise early," "With truthfulness you will get through the world," "Love of the Fatherland and honor are the most important good," and the like. I read Rodziewiczówna, Kraszewski, Sienkiewicz, Mickiewicz, Słowacki, Konopnicka. The ideals of those writers became my ideals. I was foolish and I am foolish, although so-called honest. I wrote many pieces set already after the war, but those are, well, consequences of the war.
I would still like to write a lot about the children, about their adolescent years, about their studies and their lives as adults. One thing that cannot be changed is that their worries, their lives, arouse in me a constant fear; they often rob me of sleep. Although many things make me happy, although I would like at least to embroider some pretty things, because in fact that's about all I know how to do (I can't play [music], I can't paint), in the end I would rather die in order to stop constantly fearing and worrying about the children.
[Erased, almost illegible lament about the children]
We took ... a garden plot to somehow keep going. Our children are good, but a bit standoffish, and they don't even like being looked at, and as for touching them—God forbid. One can't say anything affectionate either. I go around like a fool and pretend that I am indifferent to them, that everything is fine; what I'm writing now will also be criticized and poorly received. Lila once told me that in England, generally in the West, as soon as children grow up they split off from their parents and hardly take an interest in each other. Can it be like that? I know that more than once I made mistakes in our mutual relations, but I never did anything bad deliberately. Do I know—maybe Otuś won't worry much about the children, but I don't know whether Lila will be indifferent to how Romuś arranges his life. I know, Liluś, that you cover not only thousands of km to be in Poland, but also to see us. Forgive me that sometimes in anger I blurted something foolish; I have regretted every unkind word and I still do. I regret that I watch television when you are here; I do it deliberately, as if it's nothing since you'll soon be leaving anyway. And again I'd like to sleep through this time so as not to fear a mishap during your journey. For Tata it's a thousand times easier, for though supposedly a fatalist, he is a thousand times more of an optimist than I am. When you were little, Lilusiu, and the doctor found enlarged hilar lymph nodes in you, as soon as I walked out onto the street I cried out of fear for you. That's what a scaredy-cat I am. I know that for you, Lilu, every trip to Poland is coupled with disappointment. When one longs, everything gets idealized, and here the two of us, Tata and I, are getting older, and with age we accumulate many different habits, faults, unpleasant changes in appearance and in the way we move. Well, youth has its rights—can't old age have them too?
Toward the end I wrote some "nonsense," and that's mainly why I dragged my feet about handing over this "diary," and I felt like cutting out the last pages, but here you have it, Lilu.
Mama.
