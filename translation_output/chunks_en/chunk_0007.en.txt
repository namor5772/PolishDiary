We were lately living in such a wilijka [attic room/outbuilding?] upstairs, and downstairs, right after the Germans entered, Jews moved in. It was a very wealthy childless family. They wanted to leave some things with us for safekeeping. Tulu, however, absolutely would not agree. One time, when we had both gone out of the house, they begged Babcia and basically forced in a pile of suitcases and beautiful fluffy blankets. I returned from town and “laid into” Babcia with reproaches. Tulu came back and firmly ordered me to take that luggage back to the Jews. Tulu was convinced that keeping things—and even more so using them, taking advantage of them—of Jews so cruelly persecuted would bring misfortune down on us as well. Maybe he was right?! I returned it and I do not regret it. The Jews were taken to the Ghetto—they surely perished. It is monstrously cruel, a terrible disgrace for the Germans and the Ukrainians who with all their heart helped to liquidate and persecute the Jews. I remember how the Ghetto burned, how a shootout broke out because the Jews defended themselves. I wandered like a madwoman, my head hurt without pause. And yet one had to live. I gathered a whole bag of old shoes to use them to repair the three most serviceable pairs. Bad luck had it that the cobbler lived opposite the gate of the ghetto. I saw a vehicle driving out of it. It was a truck loaded with Jews. They were crammed in, hunched over, because on their backs lay a huge wooden “deka” [cover/planking], and on it sat several Ukrainian militiamen with rifles ready to fire. Tulu’s apprentice saw with his own eyes how over the common graves—pits—planks had been thrown, on which the Jews, stripped naked, stood, and they were shot by Gestapo men. They had machine guns resting on tripods; when they got tired of killing, they lit a cigarette, had a bite to eat, and back “to work.” The next day they drove a road roller over the graves covered with lime and soil.
One day, shortly after the Germans entered, I went and stood in line for bread; because they took me for a Jewess, the Ukrainians began to murmur, to look at me menacingly. Fortunately, a neighbor (a Pole) was standing not far away, who had lived in Krzemieniec since birth and therefore was better known than I, and she began to explain that I was a Catholic Pole and not a Jewess.
Still, I did not get any bread, even though I proved myself to the shopkeeper with a chain with the Mother of God, and I witnessed a cruel scene. I overheard a commotion and screams coming from the neighboring entryway and saw a Jew in a caftan with sidelocks burst out into the street. Several people ran after him, but “people” from the queue joined them; they grabbed stones and literally stoned that Jew. The little street was neither paved nor asphalted. Once I saw an old Jewish woman carrying on a “koromysła” [shoulder yoke] two wooden pails of water; the road went uphill, down which a sled came with the carter standing on it. The peasant deliberately drove into the Jewish woman, who got under the sled, and they dragged that screaming Jewish woman along, and the peasant brandished his whip and did not stop. I too screamed in horror.
