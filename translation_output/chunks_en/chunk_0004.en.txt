Gena Majkowa—Tula’s cousin—wrote to us at the beginning of the war. She wrote that her husband Adam—the headmaster in Małoryta near Chełm Lubelski—had died, and she—(his wife)—was left without means to live on, with three children. After some deliberation we wrote her a letter to come to us, that somehow we would scrape by together. Despite the war I kept the flat clean, floors polished, clean bedding. We took her in like our own, into our beds, into the shared kitchen. After a short time I realized that lice from them had overrun us, and from then on, for almost the whole war, lice and lice, and here there was no soap, [soda], both under the Bolsheviks and the Germans. The second matter was the shared food. Genia did not want to give up good eating. She sulked when, for example, milk soups were half and half with water, when I divided meat among several dinners. The third matter was her eldest son, Tadzik. The boy at the beginning of the war was about 14 and stole habitually. He robbed us, he robbed his mother, he “sponged off” acquaintances by invoking kinship with us. I suppose that was the parents’ fault. He was one of twins. His brother died, and over Tadzik the parents doted and allowed him everything. At the moment when they came to us, Tadzik was about 14, Krysia about 3 years old, and Ceśiu about 2. At that time we occupied 3 rooms, a balcony and a kitchen. I cannot stand that Tadek, I separated myself—ceding them one room and a place in the kitchen. Genia went to work at the brewery. We could, however, have lived together under one roof if not for Tadek. Even the Milicja came to us because of Tadek. There was no help—we had to move out. The owners of a vacant flat demanded six months’ rent in advance. We sold for this purpose my gold Omega watch, Tula’s suit, added from Tula’s pay, and we moved. We were, as they say, quite “broke”, without money, without food, but in the house on Lipowa Street there was peace. Not for long, however, because the war between the Germans and the Z P P R [USSR] came.
On Lipowa Street we lived on the upper floor. We also had 3 rooms, a balcony, a little kitchen. One small room was hung with beautiful display cases with insects. The display cases were made by a carpenter according to Tula’s design, at our expense. The collections were beautiful; they remained in the Krzemieniec museum. The work and value truly priceless. Ever since I met Tula he was always collecting something; there was not a single excursion that took place without some purpose, and above all catching insects and collecting plants. At night we would also go out with white sheets and flashlights for moths. All our belongings remained in Krzemieniec: insects, plant collections, books, paintings, furniture, dishes, bedding.
The Germans
One day Tulu came back from a conference and says that something is “in the air” and that the inspector, a Russian, was reassuring the teachers and advised them to go for a walk to Góra Bona (there were then, and still are, ruins of Bona’s castle there. From that hill there is a beautiful view of Krzemieniec and the immediate surroundings). The next day there was a stir in the town. There was nothing to eat at home. I took Ania in my arms and stood in the “queue” for bread. I was standing on Szeroka Street when suddenly shooting began; two Germans on a motorcycle appeared on the street. Fortunately Tulu left the house, found me, snatched Ania up in his arms and we jumped into the stream flowing right behind the houses. The streets emptied at once. Along the stream we went up, ran across Szeroka Street, jumped onto our little street and into the house, but without bread, which from then on we constantly lacked; from then on hunger took up residence in our house. One enemy fled—the other seized us. The Soviets, just before the Germans entered, murdered all the prisoners. People returned from the prison in tears, and some recognized among the bestially murdered—their relatives, acquaintances.
