Lilusia felt those times the most; in 1939 she was 6 years old. She most often hid in the cellar during air-raid alarms; with all her might she wanted there to be a home, and yet everything was falling apart. She had enlarged hilar glands [hilar lymph nodes], and I was terribly worried about her. In our family three siblings had died of tuberculosis; Tulu’s brother died of tuberculosis. Whenever I went out of the house I cried, and here the child was going hungry. Our neighbor’s husband, Mr Kruczkowski, was the manager of a state estate, thus a German one. They were living then in the countryside in a manor house (in Buchłów); they had everything in abundance. They offered to take Lila in for a while.
She had attentive care, splendid fare—dairy, meat, fruit—but what of it; Lila sought secluded places in the park and cried. The doctor who visited them said she was crying for home. Tulu went by bicycle and had to bring her home. She insisted that for one Easter (it was our last holiday there) we whitewash the house. I had a broken arm in a cast then—luckily the left one—so with my right hand I whitewashed and washed. Her First Holy Communion took place in the lyceum church. She attended preparations very briefly. She had a borrowed little dress; the wooden sandals—Tulu made them. The upper part was from my white felt hat. I prepared a wreath and a candle, and I let down her beautiful hair, and she had long braids then. When the neighbor women—Poles—learned that Lila was going to First Holy Communion, they brought her a veil at the last moment and pinned it on her head themselves. Babcia did not live to see that moment, and Lila went to church alone, for I had no one to leave the children with, and I was ashamed to go with the children because I had nothing to dress them in. I did not have much time to look after her education, and Tulu didn’t know how. Once she had almost taught herself to read and write, Tulu would give her his student “textbooks” and make her read aloud. Of course she later told me she understood nothing of them. All told, throughout the entire war, as I calculated, Lila attended school only 15 months. A few months in Zmigrod, a few weeks in Turza, and a few months in Zawada. In N. Sącz she immediately went on to secondary school. In some subjects she had more than a good grasp—of others she had not the slightest idea. In his free time Tulu painted; he also gave Lila paints and cardboard, and I remember her first picture: it was a fir sprig in a little vase. Where are you now, my Lilusia?!
Otuś was 2 at the outbreak of the war. Like Lila, he had had scarlet fever. Lila had enlarged hilar glands [hilar lymph nodes], and Otuś a murmur in his little heart. The child was growing; there was nothing to dress him in. I didn’t know how to sew, which was simply a misfortune, especially in wartime; besides, I didn’t have a machine. Since childhood I had always liked to embroider. I couldn’t afford a dressmaker during the war, a hairdresser was out of the question as well, so I cut Otuś’s hair myself “à la pot” [bowl cut]. I cobbled together some shirts and blouses by hand, but they looked “pożal się Boże” [pathetic]. Otuś was often ill. In Krzemieniec he came down with pneumonia, and here there was neither doctor nor medicines. We had acquaintances who worked in a German military hospital, and from them we got some pills, only I don’t remember what kind—and I put on branki [bańki, cupping], and somehow it helped him just as it had helped Lila. Education consisted above all of piles of prewar “Płomyczek” issues and Babcia’s stories, and from time to time my reading children’s books to them. I liked to sing to the children and I still marvel at myself how I could do that in such macabre times. The children’s education also included Tulu’s bicycle outings with Otuś and Lila in turns. They rode through the forests, they rode to the [Ikwę] until the Ukrainians began to murder, for then one couldn’t even “stick one’s nose” out of the town. I taught Otuś to read and write in his sixth year during regular lessons with Bogna, Nusia’s daughter. This was already after our escape from Krzemieniec. From his earliest years Otuś made plańiki [plany, little maps] and liked to look at atlases. I remember how, after my arm had been set, I was coming back from the hospital after a night spent there. I was returning to the children anxious and at the same time happy, and from afar I saw Ania and Otuś standing on the little porch. As I began calling to them, the children disappeared into my small barrel that stood on the small balcony. They (the children) thought I had been completely deprived of one arm, and that’s why they hid. Anusia, as they say, was born under bombs. As long as she was an infant there was no problem, for she had a carriage, a pillow, and shirts after Otuś, but the older she got, the worse it was. Her first little dress was reworked from a wall hanging of gray linen, but the little dress was sewn by a seamstress; I only embroidered it with stars. She later had more little dresses, but this one I remember most. Babcia admired her wise, large eyes, but she remembers Babcia little, for she was barely 2 when Babcia died. Often up to a year and a half she cried; evidently she had some pains, but nothing strange—sometimes even animals die from rye [from hunger]. She had no toys, of course. I would tell her at the age of 3–4 how Oluś and Lila used to throw bananas and oranges under the bed before the war—Ania would ask what those fruits looked and tasted like. I remember how once I got hold of bolted flour, and Ania didn’t want to eat dumplings made from it, saying she didn’t want such sticky dumplings. In Zmigrod near Jasło she was probably about 4 already, and although she was truly an exceptionally bright little girl, she couldn’t pronounce “r”. Mr Kahl—a worker at the dairy—was delighted and paid her for reciting a little poem,
