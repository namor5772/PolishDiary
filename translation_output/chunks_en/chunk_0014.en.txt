There’s a saying that in the old days, when Sądeczanie turned to Starosądeczanie (Stary Sącz, a small town 7 km from Sącz) to borrow a gallows, they were refused, with the words that they had it for themselves and their children. That is, in general, the mentality of the people here. Right after the war I reported to the inspectorate asking for a job in Nowy Sącz. I was refused and was being offered one in the countryside. Tulu taught at the liceum, the children went to the liceum, there was no public transport. The roads were awful. To live in a village with the younger children and run two households?! So I had to give up and we had to live on Tulu’s meager salary. In Sącz only their own people worked. Tulu probably wouldn’t have gotten a job either, but he had already started in January 1946, and there was a lack of people with higher education.
Only thanks to strong patronage (our neighbor Janas was an inspector) did I get, in ’58, a job in Biczyce; it was a contract. Buses already ran; besides, whenever I could I commuted by bicycle. My zeal knew no bounds; I had longed for this work for years. I also studied on my own, because during the years of “unemployment” I had forgotten many things amid the menial chores. In Biczyce I put on plays, trips; I had good results, and that may have contributed to my getting a job in Chełmiec, and this time a permanent post. In Chełmiec it was drudgery! Every year I painted benches, doors, windows, laid out little gardens; I bought aquariums and teaching aids, especially for history, with my own money. I staged performances (for one performance the sets and costume designs were made for me by Lila, who happened to have arrived then from England). That performance even ended up in the press. At the performance—or rather a staging of the poetry of M. Konopnicka—old people cried, even the teachers. I read Pan Tadeusz and Sienkiewicz to the children “from cover to cover,” and finally I was building a school. A school had to be built there sooner or later, but it was mainly my efforts that brought the construction forward by a good few years. The conditions there were terrible. The children were crammed into a former C. K. Austrian building at a crossroads. When cars passed, the ceilings shook, until one day there was a failure and one ceiling threatened to collapse completely. The large classrooms upstairs and two on the ground floor were taken out of service. To get any additional rooms it was necessary to organize a march with the children to the Presidium of the Powiat National Council; I argued, I was the initiator. They rushed in from the Party and finally gave us the keys to an old three-room granary. One class had only one window. The children were going blind. I took photos of those “facilities,” and having faithfully described the conditions (the meeting with the authorities took place in the evening in the Remiza, so no one would have bothered to come to the school anyway), I backed up my words with the photos, which I handed to the authorities. A pity I didn’t keep any as a memento. After that meeting the Komitet Budowy Szkoły was formed, and I myself put forward my candidacy for secretary. The whole family helped me in drafting various letters. Otuś helped me a great deal; by virtue of serving as a referent in the spatial planning department he knew the plans for the expansion of Chełmiec, etc. There were many opponents of building the new school; the various intrigues and obstacles would not be written down even on an oxhide [i.e., innumerable], but at last the construction of the school was approved, and that same year the foundation work began. Within a year a beautiful 12-room school was built. However, such disgust at those people came over me that I transferred to Nowy Sącz. I got a job at Szkoła Podstawowa Nr 13 – Cwiczeń. It is a promotion, but the work is also enormous and the premises are very poor.
Since I am already on this subject, I will add my transition to retirement. It was not, despite my 64 years, voluntary. They forced me out, because I felt fine and the teaching profession is my life’s passion. Anticipating that they would dismiss me I submitted an application to the inspectorate and the kuratorium asking to keep me employed. Nothing helped. I copy here my application.
