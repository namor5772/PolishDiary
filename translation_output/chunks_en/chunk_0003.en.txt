I am a beggar, beggar
What will I eat, eat
I’ll go to the little market
I’ll buy a little loaf of bread
I will eat it, eat

These were the sweetest moments in those macabre times. One could not reconcile oneself to the fact that everything was “Topło” [‘melted’], as the Ukrainians said. It seemed to me that I could keep it all together if the house was clean. I don’t know where I got the strength, the energy from. The first Easter holidays were approaching. I baked some cookies and bought a quarter of a pig from clandestine slaughter. I made lots of sausages. I polished the floors and washed the runners. These were the most wonderful holidays in the entire war. There was even spirytus at home, which Tulu received from the division [distribution] from the Muzeum Ziemi Krzemienieckiej. For this spirytus I received produce from the peasants. Tulu slept in a separate room, with a pile of books by him because he was preparing for lessons. I with the children and Babcia in the bedroom. At midnight I hear the sound of bells on a sleigh (although it was Easter, snow was coming down—the holiday was in March). It was the time of deportations to Siberia. Someone is pounding on the door from the courtyard side. I open in my nightgown and several Bolshevik soldiers barge into the apartment. One took position by the door with a rifle and the rest scattered through the apartment. Tulu berat. [unclear] They conducted a search, went through the books. Babcia was somehow unwell and was trembling with fear, begging the soldiers for her son’s life. Next .... they ordered that they be given vodka (I diluted our entire supply of spirytus with juice), I served the leftovers of meat, lard, garlic, and onion. They drank, ate, wrestled among themselves, made a mess all over the house, and left toward morning. With difficulty I got the apartment back in order.
