The death of Babcia Dudowa
It is actually connected with that hunger. Babcia was vigorous, and if not for the war she would have lived much longer. She liked meat, fats, and then suddenly hunger; so she weakened a great deal. One time Julek Unold (Aunt Hela’s husband) came to Krzemieniec with a consignment of tobacco. He stopped by and talked me into going to Chodak (40 km) so that I could bring back some food. I pulled out the remaining clothes for barter and was just about to leave, when Babcia made a scene at me for leaving them alone. I explain that after all I will bring home some bacon, flour, butter, but Babcia stayed angry. I was already downstairs and about to get onto the cart, but “something nudged me” — I turned back and said a heartfelt goodbye to Babcia. To this day I regret that I left then, because after all Babcia would have lived longer. In Chodaki I bartered the clothes primarily for fat, and every day I went to the quern to grind wheat, because Julek told me that however much I ground, that much I could take with me to Krzemieniec. Hela and I would go together (Hela was pregnant with Alek then) because they too were grinding for themselves on the quern. I was terribly impatient, and that neighbor, who also was to go with a consignment of tobacco, kept delaying the departure because the Germans were not allowing anyone to leave Chodak. Only after about 10 days did I leave Chodak, and on the way, in Szumsk, I received a telegram that Babcia had died. It was at the end of winter. The apartment was cold. To get to the kitchen you went through the hall - the kitchen was above the stairs. Babcia warmed herself by the stove in the room, and she would go out to the kitchen to cook something for the children and must have come down with pneumonia. Before Tulu realized and called a doctor, it was already too late. If I had been there, maybe she wouldn’t have caught cold, or I would have put cupping glasses on Babcia right away and she would have been saved. I cried terribly, and I still grieve for her. I know that if she were alive now she would be about 100, but I feel sad that she doesn’t watch television, doesn’t listen to music, and she was very musical. She doesn’t enjoy the grandchildren — or maybe she does?! I beg my mama for care over my children, and perhaps ask her, Babcia Dudowa, for it too? Together with Tulu we put up a little monument on her grave (three years ago, in 1970), and somehow I feel lighter. In life she would go for walks to the “Cmentarz Tunicki,” sit on the grave of Słowacki’s mother, and say to Lili that she would bring her (Babcia) flowers because she wanted to be buried here. That is what happened - her grave is right next to the grave of Salomea Słowacka. I remember that I sewed tights from my red sweater for Ania (from the sleeves) and for Otuś (from the back). The children (Ania and Otuś) had no notion of death and were chasing each other around the catafalque. Babcia’s old accordion remained in a trunk in Krzemieniec.
