We arrived in Kąty on a beautiful September day. Sun, fruit on the trees. We set up a "camp" at a farmer friend’s—Wokurka’s—in a new house under the hill. Aunt Nusia drove us there and turned back to Zmigrod to save and secure the property. Meanwhile the front closed in at once and took Kąty into its range. Some inhabitants took refuge in the forests with their cattle, some in vaulted cellars. We spread kilims on the floor and lay down “like pancakes” on them: sick Julek, his six-year-old daughter Bogna, Tulu, I, Lila, Otuś, and Ania. Our hosts fled to the forest. The house trembles from exploding bullets, plaster falls from the walls and covers us with dust, the room is white with it. Out of the blue the first Soviet soldier enters the house, opens a window, sets up a machine gun in it, and fires. I begged him to leave this house because there are children and a seriously ill man here. It did no good. He advised us to leave the house, but how, Julek was on crutches, little children, and out in the open bullets were whistling thickly. Where to go?! The forest is too far, and we don’t know how far to any cellar. (The cellars were separate, almost completely dug into the ground, only the round roofs stuck up above the earth.) With a heavy heart we leave Julek behind (at his insistent requests), the children put on their little coats, we grab only a suitcase with documents and, literally between bullets, we sneak and run, wanting to reach some cellar. We must have come upon a large one [we duże: perhaps a large cellar], and no one took us in. Under the little roof of one cellar stood a peasant who magnanimously advised us to hide by the root cavity of trees by the Wisłoka. Indeed there are tall trees along the Wisłoka; we run down the steep bank and nestle into a hollow under the roots. Above us, the Bolsheviks; on the opposite bank of the Wisłoka, the Germans. A battle! Bullets plop right at our feet as they fall into the water. At one point a German figure with rifle ready to fire emerges from beyond the corner of a house on the other side of the Wisłoka. I went numb, because he was aiming in our direction. Perhaps he realized we were civilians with children—we stayed alive. We sat under that root cavity almost until dusk. In the meantime Tulu “visited” Julek twice. Although the house had no window panes left, Julek survived. Toward evening we got into acquaintances’ cellar. It was tiny; along one wall stood chests with the hosts’ clothing and linens. We lined the free half with kilims. Two-thirds of the little cellar was a single bed on which sometimes 13–14 people slept side by side. Except for the small children, no one could straighten their legs. Poor, tall, sick Julek! The little cellar, especially at night, shook to its foundations; heavy tanks drove right past the door. If a shell had hit the roof, we would all have been buried. In the morning it was quieter. Then we would leave the little cellar. Nusia and I combed and washed the children. We cooked in the cottage, and, on the sly and in haste, we peeled potatoes and even ground grain on quernstones. We had fat in the form of rendered butter. Just before the offensive I bought a little piglet; of course it stayed in Zmigrod, but our acquaintance Jan Nowak (now a judge) killed it and brought us half to Kąty. We cooked “ein Topf,” and only Julek ate separately; the rest from one pot. Kąty fell back into German hands. Corpses of soldiers were strewn all over the village. Tulu had to bury them. In the neighboring house there was the so-called “Szreibsztuba.” The Germans drove any civilians they caught to build a bridge that Soviet planes were bombing. Tulu was driven there several times. The Germans caught chickens all over Kąty and made me and Nusia pluck them. One time I started cursing, calling the Germans Szwaby and so on. One of them, who was dozing, leaning against the kitchen table, understood Polish; he sprang at me with a revolver—I bolted for the cellar—the German after me, and only when Tulu blocked his way and began to excuse me did it help, for the German waved it off and left. Among the Germans milling about there were also cultured ones, even with a heart. Am I overdoing it with that “heart”? But the fact is—the same German almost every day would pick Ania up, carry her to the supply truck, and load her up with either sugar or some canned goods. The front dragged on; to us it felt like ages. We decided to get out of Kąty. But how? The point from which one could leave the front by army vehicle was far, especially for sick, limping Julek, and then there were the little children and some odds and ends. Nusia learned that the German on whom our fate depended was celebrating his imieniny or birthday. She gathered some autumn flowers from neighboring gardens and went to offer good wishes. She returned with a promise that they would get us out of Kąty, only that we had to reach the point on our own. On foot was impossible because Julek was lame, small children, baggage. Any means of transport depended on the head of the “Szreibsztube.” It fell to me to procure that wagon. I went to the German and he started making advances—fortunately a front-line soldier came to report, and that saved me. We got the wagon. We loaded it with our belongings, seated sick Julek and little Ania on it; Lila, Oluś, and Bogna clung to the back of the wagon and rode standing. We had not gone far when the Soviets began raking the road with a hurricane of fire. It was hell. We snatched up Ania, helped Julek down in a flash, and took refuge in the nearest cellar. Meanwhile our carter whipped the horses on with our belongings to the vehicles’ departure point. Again, a terrible problem—how to get there with sick Julek and little children. Not far away there was an improvised first-aid post. Nusia and I went there. The head doctor was furious, living essentially on black coffee and cigarettes because he was performing amputations on wounded Germans without a break. Somehow we persuaded someone from the auxiliary staff and they gave us an ambulance, in which Julek arrived. The children and we went on foot. Our things were piled in an empty barn—another attack. Lila and Otuś were in the barn then, and its roof tiles were showering onto the yard. Naturally we came through that as well. But, to sink us completely, a pelting rain set in; mud up to our ankles, and through that mud we carried our odds and ends to the truck waiting for us. When the children scrambled under the truck’s tarp, a puddle literally formed around each of them. Not one of the children, nor even we, so much as sneezed. At last we drove beyond the front line—it felt almost silly in that silence. They took us, late at night, to some locality, and we found ourselves in an empty room with straw and hay on the floor. The Germans who were sitting in rooms farther in gave us hot black coffee, and we lay down to sleep side by side. In the morning we set off again. The driver was a bit tipsy and wanted to deliver us right to the house in Turza near Gorlice. In that house lived Julek’s brother, a teacher in Turza. Just before the destination this ride nearly ended in tragedy. The road was slippery, clayey, climbing uphill; on the left and right a steep drop, the so-called “paryje.” The truck was right on the edge of the precipice when Ania let out a terrible scream and the unfortunate driver cut the engine. We got out carefully so the truck wouldn’t tip over, and partly on foot, partly on the wagon brought by Kazik Kędzior, we reached our destination. Nusia, with Julek and Bogna, moved into a tiny room at Kazik’s, and we stayed nearby with a widow.
