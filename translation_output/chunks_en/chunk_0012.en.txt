It was a little house made up of 3 small rooms, a kitchen, and a large veranda. It also had a patch of garden. Tulu taught—I, out of necessity, only ran the household—because the teaching post they offered me was far out in the village—they wouldn’t give me one in Sącz. It was hard in every respect, financially and in terms of every convenience. Water was far away, lighting was kerosene. In the flat the “furniture” consisted of two beds from Zawada (each different); I borrowed [another] simple wooden bed from an old schoolmate and that was the “bedroom,” the iron one stood in the other little room. There was trouble with the ticking for the mattresses because you had to go all the way to Zawada for straw. The “etagères” were made from UNRRA boxes (these were packages sent by the USA for the starving population), precisely “United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration,” an international organization set up in the USA in 1943 under the banner of providing economic aid to the peoples of countries destroyed by war, dissolved in 1947. Curtains hung on strings. The second room had an iron bed, a huge table from the Jesuit boarding school, and chairs the pupils carried over for us, along with two nightstands. Tulu somehow got hold at school of a huge wardrobe, which served us both as a clothes wardrobe and partly as a pantry. We whitewashed the flat ourselves (later every year Hania came from Zawada, or Józia Kulawa’s mother—Przybyłowa). The garden with two apple trees was important; I bought about 2 bushes of “smorodyn” [currants]. I was very happy with that garden and put a lot of work into it. Tulu earned little. I walked to Zawada for potatoes. They never brought even a measure [miarka], perhaps later when we were ordering 3–6 m. for the winter [of firewood] and 2–3 kopy of cabbage [kopa = 60 heads]. I dug those potatoes myself for free and naturally loaded myself with them like a horse—a backpack completely full and two bags—and walked 6 km one way with that. Often I literally had nothing to give the children for supper, and then I remember during the long June days we simply went to bed. I gave private lessons. Various mothers also came asking for a recommendation from Tulu. They wanted to give something—I excused myself but inwardly begged God that they would insist and leave the present. Food queues were like a continuation of the war—a plague. They would allot 1 kg, sometimes even 1/2 kg of sugar or flour, and you’d stand for hours in a queue for that! The children didn’t want to stand. I was often shoved out of the line—I had to argue, and our children were cross with me because of it. When they started rationing food it was a bit better, but there was too little of it to avoid standing in queues altogether. Clothing was a nightmare. Marysia Korpińska worked with American relief and about three times brought a few little clothes in a handbag. Sometimes Aunt Hela (she worked in Kudowa, and her eldest son Kazik attended our high school, and later all three boys were with us) sent some German cast-off “rags,” and that’s how we managed, but step by step it got a little better. We went with the children to Kudowa to Hela’s about twice; compared to us she had a lovely flat, and we didn’t want to go back from her place to our junk. I very often had headaches; in general, in the afternoons I felt like “peas by the path.” Otuś probably worried about it the most and sometimes late at night brought me painkillers from the neighbors. These were probably all the effects of wartime experiences and hard work. When the gate creaked, I would freeze with fright. The displaced doctor Isterewicz told me to lie “flat on my stomach,” measure my pulse, and take some medicines. That whole “affair” was before Easter; I then ran the children from bed—Lila kneaded and baked the cake. I rested—I came out of it, and often it seemed to me afterward that there was no job I couldn’t manage. And there was plenty of work, because already on Chełmiecka Street almost without interruption, besides our own children, we initially had Hela’s two boys and later three. Naturally, no washing machine, no water, no light. To somehow make ends meet I leased a piece of field from Bastowa—our milkwoman. The stay was enlivened by Hela’s visits—first with the children and later to the children. I remember for one holiday I started early to put aside flour and sugar and then baked cakes from 30 kg of flour. It wasn’t much at all for six children. Iwonka was only born on 30 Oct 1949. For the girls—or for Lila—I sewed coats from blankets. One Christmas Eve we had borscht with soap. In winter we ran the kitchen in one room. A makeshift iron stove, one table with the children crowded around it, a kerosene lamp, dark. I hastily set the ladle down on a bar of soap, which stuck to it and fell into the borscht. We always had a lot of fish for the holidays—it was the cheapest “dunajcówka” [fish from the Dunajec]. For Christmas Eve we sat on the bench, on the bed, on two chairs, on crates. Tulu would take out several of his little tweezers for removing fish bones. There was always kutia and apple strudel.
The children helped me a lot—there were weekly duty rotas; the older ones also had to carry water, light the stove, sweep, and run errands.
30 Oct 1948, Iwonka was born. Maybe it was a reaction after the war, or maybe self-defense against approaching old age—anyway, we were all happy at Iwonka’s birth. I looked up her names in the calendar. The whole family knew we were going to have a child. The christening was solemn. The godmother was Hela and the godfather Olek—my siblings. The children went to school, went away for the holidays, I stayed by myself. The aunts found her name “Iwonka,” and that’s what we called her and still do. Only when enrolling her in school did I learn what name Tulu had really given her: Urszula–Elżbieta. That was Tulu’s beloved “Koszulka,” as Tulu called her. Before Iwonka’s birth we often went together to the Chełmiec forest, or to Klimkówka—to the forests of my youth. I’m extremely fond of orchids, and when I saw them for the first time after the war in the Sącz forest, I literally shouted for joy. We went to Rytro, Głębokie. Those were also the places I had gone to already in childhood. It was hard, there was a lot of work, but the home was pleasant, the little street quiet. We kept dogs—first there was “Ksenia.” The children were heading to that library and burst into the house screaming that Ksenia was dead. They cried terribly—a Soviet car had run her over. The second dog was a splendid German Shepherd—Reks. He went bathing with us, went on walks. The end of the idyll came when our house was bought by the hairdresser Jurkowski. Some Jew, a successor, turned up and sold the house. From that moment on Jurkowski kept visiting us. He tore off apples, piled junk in the yard. He fixed the roof, and finally he put poison out for the dog. We tried to save him. We took him to the vet, gave him milk to drink, and the dog recovered. But not for long, because when he dosed him a second time, nothing helped. That Jurkowski was worse than a brute. Then he started pestering us to swap flats with him. He tormented us so much that we finally decided to do it. We gave him the cultivated garden, a clean flat, and he [gave us] a bedbug-infested flat and a dreadful yard, because Jurkowski kept pigs and a cow. The yard was one manure heap. Work in the garden simply swept me away. We covered the manure heap, dug over the entire yard and the garden in front of the house. At first we had all vegetables in abundance, later there was less because the sycamore and the big apple trees grew and shaded part of the garden. There were so many flowers that when there wasn’t money for bread, Olek and Alek went to the market and sold them. Even so, the financial situation was hard, and so I bought small piglets, raised them .... in the .... cellar, and after some time called the butcher. Kazik and Lila were already at university. When the piglet got turned into puddings and sausage, both we and the children in Kraków had something to eat. Exactly when Iwonka was 6 years old we were tempted once more by a little dog. It was a tiny German Shepherd, like a little ball. He grew up together with the children, was their darling, and especially Iwonka adored him. Tragedy struck him already at our present flat. They poisoned him. I went on a trip with Tulu and Iwonka was home alone—she took it terribly hard. I don’t want any dog or cat anymore. Szaruś, that little cat from Krzemieniec, also died of poison. In general the Sącz people are mean—they threw us out of food queues and threw us out of two houses, poisoned our dogs, cut down that lovely little tree we had planted, covered the flowers with sand.
Hela moved in with us for good, with her furniture—I threw out those cobbled-together odds and ends and then it was so-so at home, but the crowding was terrible—in the first year in Helena there were 10 of us. In summer it was half bearable because the little room in the attic saved us, but winter was awful. On top of that, chronic lack of money, because Hela initially worked as a housekeeper in a boarding school and earned very little. Tulu taught from morning till night (at times over 60 hours a week), but it was still too little, especially when autumn came and we had to stock the house with fuel, potatoes, cabbage, shoes and coats for the children. Usually, when I went to town over the bridge, I cried, or prayed to find some money or for someone from America to send us some. Lila and Kazek were already at university, Olek was finishing high school, Radek and Ania were catching up to him. I leased a field from Bastowa for potatoes, and once I even sowed wheat, but I had an awful lot of trouble with it. Hela and I washed and dyed old clothes and reworked them into new ones. Finally we hit on an idea and started embroidering blouses, dresses, collars. Tulu helped us with this, because he drew new patterns and transferred them. Lila had her part in it too. Sometimes we embroidered all night long. So as not to fall asleep, in summer we embroidered with the window open and, in the process, listened to the nightingales.
At last Hela moved to her own flat, which she managed to get with great difficulty. She took part of the furniture, and then we bought on installments a light dining-room suite. I was terribly pleased with it. Hela left the piano but only temporarily—on it Iwonka played, and a little Ania, and even Lila when she came to Poland from England. But the time for the piano came too—Kazek Unold took it. I felt sad, because since childhood my dream had been a piano. Violins wear me out when someone “saws” them. I like a violin orchestra. I love the piano immensely, I just can’t stand banging on the keys. I stood on my head and bought an old piano for 11,000 zł. That piano just stands there, because Iwonka is away from home, and when she comes she plays very little. Lila isn’t here. Nor is Otuś. Ania is far away. The piano is to be taken by Iwonka. Such was our fortune—our lot—that nowhere could we warm a place for long, and we had to leave the house in Helena. That little house was cracked—the fissure was visible right through—but Borus had his kennel there, and there were those few beds. Our landlord sold the house to Mrs Wróblówna. She bought it very cheaply and started persecuting us to move. We submitted an application to the housing office; we didn’t want a private house—besides, where to? Housing commissions said we had sufficient square meters; we wrote piles of applications—in vain, and meanwhile Wróblówna first cut down that pretty maple I had planted, then covered the little garden flowers with sand, tore up a piece of ceiling in the basement rooms, so that the floor in the room next to the kitchen lay only on joists for several winters. On top of that the stoves smoked, I swept out the soot twice a year. It was so cold in the flat that in winter the water in the kitchen constantly froze. What were we to do?! Renovate? With what? For whom? When Lila came with little Romuś (the second time), Wróblówna had a pit dug next to the house supposedly to check the state of the foundations—we were afraid Romuś would fall into it. After Lila left, I hit upon the idea of not whitewashing the flat, not stuffing the cracks with plaster but with cotton wool. It looked awful. With difficulty I called in a sanitary commission in winter, which found the conditions inhuman, but again the regular housing commission ruled that all these “deficiencies” were removable. “Round and round we went.” This tug-of-war disgusted me horribly!! Wróblówna was obliged to give us a flat, but she was in every sense of the word a SWINE. That wealthy, solitary woman. When they finally assigned us a flat, she didn’t want to give a penny for the deposit (6,000 zł), for the move, or for the apple trees planted by us. We got deeply into debt then, both to the ZNP and in ORS (Obsługa Ratalnej Sprzedaży—Installment Sale Service). If not for Tulu’s pupil—Furtek—there would also have been the costs of the move. There was a big problem with piles of books, newspapers, and other clutter that Tulu by no means wanted to part with, and the flat had an area of 46 square meters + a small cellar. I hit on an idea and, with my own money and the management’s consent, fenced off the storage under the stairs—now we have two little cellars; into one we crammed piles of books and newspapers, the other serves as a handy storeroom. Who and when will make use of those newspapers and old books? Water, a bathroom, and radiators are a wonderful thing, but the surroundings are dreadful—a kolkhoz. Our block is right in the very middle. There’s no balcony—you can’t go even an hour without curtains in the evening and, by day, without sheers. Smoke from the boiler room pours between the blocks as if through a chimney. Trampled lawns, children screaming. In the little house in Helena, when I embroidered at night with the window open, I heard nightingales singing. I long for greenery, for a little bed, and in addition it wears me down that Tulu feels very bad, especially in winter when the boiler rooms are firing and because of Biegonice. What a terrible mistake, an irreparable loss, those Biegonice. They built a factory of cathode electrodes there (about 4 km from Sącz). The beautiful Sącz Land, smoked over, gassed. They excuse themselves that the main motive was to relieve unemployment, and what turned out?! Fewer than 2,000 people were employed. Unemployment still exists. They “displaced” hundreds of farmers, and the land is fertile, beautiful. If instead of that factory they had built, for example, a vacation–tourist complex, how much greater the benefit would have been. I would blow that factory up. In the flat the flowers don’t want to grow. Besides, our girls claim that potted plants make a flat stuffy. Personally, I would throw out half the junk and put up metal trellises, partition the flat, and hang everything with flowers. I must get flower boxes, to have flowers at least in summer. And how did poor Borus feel! But at least the dog had us. We went out with him for walks. I don’t want to describe how he died! Why don’t people understand that people can love a dog, a cat! Besides, these are Sącz people! I’m ashamed I was born here. I have the impression that since they threw us out of houses and poisoned the animals, they’d poison us too to have more room for themselves. Before we moved in here, for nearly two months I went every day and painted and cleaned the flat. Now I keep moving the furniture around, because I want to bring a little variety into the prison. They were going to bring in gas and new expenses. Now, as I’m copying this for Lila, the gas is already in—it cost about 10,000 zł. It’s convenient, but getting it installed cost an enormous amount of health and energy, because the workmen botch things, drink, and demand bribes.
I haven’t written anything about the floods in Helena. We went through one flood on Chełmiecka. The water flooded the street, the garden, reached only up to the threshold. I took the children and went to a relative on “Paścią Górę.” That relative (he’s no longer alive) was a forester. From there we watched the flood; there we ate wonderful venison (I prefer not to think of the shot little doe). Two floods and several flood alarms we went through in the second flat, and since the house had basement rooms, they were always flooded almost to the ceilings. During one flood Ania didn’t manage to leave for her practicum, because the water tore up the railway lines, and she came back home with a suitcase on her shoulder, wading through the little street nearly waist-deep in water. The boys rode in a bathtub and a washtub along the street. When the water receded, we had to carry tons of silt out of the basement rooms. With us it still wasn’t so terribly bad. From the railway track I saw houses over the Dunajec flooded with roaring, murky water up to the roofs. Soldiers were taking people out on pontoons. They waited to return to their homes at the gmina office whose building stood by the main road (now there are private flats there). With us too the Lup family installed themselves. When it rained for several days in a row, there was already an alarm. We would bring up a supply of coal from downstairs, take all the wood upstairs. We hauled in drinking water from the well, I bought bread and sugar, potatoes, and we waited for the flood. We went out in raincoats to watch the water rising on the Dunajec. In the house it was damp and “atmospheric.” Iwonka was very afraid and all night kept asking how much the water had fallen, and it was exactly the opposite—the water was rising. Here there are no floods, but there is almost daily a flood of smoke.
