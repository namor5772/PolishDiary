I think in those hard times I was very resourceful and tried somehow to keep this “home” going, and there was a Christmas tree every holiday. One holiday under the German occupation there was an announcement that under no circumstances was one allowed to have a Christmas tree, and worse still to bring one yourself from the forest. Two stubborn creatures, Gena Mojkowa and Gena Duda, went to the nearest German estate. In the park fence they found a hole and cut down two beautiful Christmas trees in the park. It was already late at night when each of us brought the children a Christmas tree. The underground press was a great joy to us. Often those little papers were already barely holding at the folds; after reading we passed them to a neighbor, naturally only to a Polish woman. We copied out various prophecies and they heartened us greatly — “hope is the mother of fools.” We still have them — maybe if I manage, I will copy them for the children. Oh, how we waited for the end of the war. My dearest dreams were, in my mind, to welcome Polish soldiers, and deep down I was sure of it, and I considered the marching Germans defeated from the start.
Somehow I managed to get in touch with Nusia, who was then in Zmigrod. She was faring far better than we were, but she couldn’t really help us because from the Gubernatorstwo one could send parcels of only 25 dkg. Nusia sent me two small parcels with new stockings. Naturally I sold them at once, and with that money I bought an iron stove with one “fajerka” [burner plate]; it saved us greatly because I set it in the room and so it warmed us at the same time and I could cook on it. I would have forgotten to write about one important thing. They gave us from the Słowacki Museum to keep in safekeeping the manuscript of Balladyna. Słowacki’s handwriting was like little pearls, even, clear, on magnificent paper. Besides that there were also poems there, such as “Smutno mi, Boże,” which Słowacki illustrated in pen. You could see he was an artist in every sense of the word. I didn’t know where to keep this treasure. Among the books I was afraid that in case of a search they would find the manuscript, and after all by hiding it under the mattresses I was exposing it just the same. I wrapped it in linen cloth and from time to time looked through it. The only thing the Germans did not liquidate was the Słowacki Museum located in the manor house where Słowacki was born. (At present the Soviet authorities have turned this little house into a library and have stacked the exhibits in the form of furniture in the attic above the general museum. In this museum there is only a small room with two display cases in which there are some mementos of Słowacki). The curator under the Germans was Dr Kryński; he was a cripple but a very educated man; he had a young and pretty wife. I was in that museum several times and I liked it there immensely: silence, perfect order. Around the little house apple trees grew; we got apples from them. We were in Krzemieniec three years ago and saw everything. You can see clearly that they are destroying all mementos and traces of Polishness. Since I am already on cultural matters, I must still mention the fate of the enormous library that was at the T. Czacki Lyceum. It had all the newest publications and, besides that, the so-called black and white ravens of our literature [rarities]. When the Bolsheviks entered Krzemieniec — Tulu worked at the Museum (he was head of the natural history department), so he had access to the lyceum buildings. He came once and, as they say, almost cried, because he saw how the Bolsheviks lit a bonfire in the courtyard and were burning and tearing beautiful books. Tulu surreptitiously brought some books, but when we fled from Krzemieniec it all was lost. One fellow saved Słowacki’s manuscript (I didn’t remember his surname), who managed to make it to Warsaw. All trace of the manuscript was lost. Had it stayed with us, it would have survived.
More about the Museum. Before the war Tulu simply devoted his life to collecting (he still does so now). As a small boy he began with matchboxes. Then he collected books, chemicals, plants and insects (now stamps, newspapers, and of course books). He collected insects with great expertise and passion. A carpenter made the display cases for him at our expense. The insects had their antennae and legs set to tenths of a millimeter; the larger insects were prepared, and, for example, caterpillars were inflated. At night the two of us hunted moths. Every walk was combined either with catching insects or collecting plants. Even little Lila paid attention to insects, which she called “eku.” I sometimes looked askance at it, because we were not rolling in money and the cases cost a lot. There were 32 of those cases. At the outbreak of the war Tulu concentrated those cases in the house. One room was hung all around with them. In each case there was an ampoule with a moth-killing agent. The cases are very tight. When we fled from Krzemieniec Tulu gave those cases to the Museum “for safekeeping,” and there they have remained to this day. When we were there with Tulu three years ago we saw them — they are beautifully preserved. Tulu now intended to open them, but I dissuaded him for fear that precisely upon opening bacteria would get in and destroy the insects. These are priceless collections. The whole satisfaction is that the present staff treated Tulu with great respect and talked about organizing a large exhibition of insects with a portrait of Tulu. In addition to these cases, there are also plants collected by Tulu in the museum. There are about two thousand. The current staff write to us and asked Tulu who was the founder of the Museum — of course it was Prof. Mączak, murdered by the Germans, and not Mr Cynkałowski, who claims to be the founder.
I cried my eyes out during our stay in Krzemieniec. I like Krzemieniec very much. Two of our children were born there; Babcia’s grave is there. Lila was born in Żołkiew, which is now renamed to “Niesterow.” Everyone there welcomed us as guests; even Mrs Turkowa, a rabid Ukrainian, gave us a jar of honey, but what of it, when everyone is waiting for the Germans. For me all this gave the impression as if I were staying in a grave. At moments it seemed to me that I could smell corpses, and everywhere it was dirty, ugly. Our relatives live in old, musty houses. Stare Brody is one ruin, the roads rutted, holes, mud, dust. The trees cut down. Not a trace of Babcia’s little house. In general people there build very little, and those new buildings are such rigged-up little houses, without fences. The shops, dirty, pitiful. People very badly dressed. Women neglected, obese. The trees cut down. Krzemieniec is, outwardly, relatively little damaged and clean, because it owes this to scholarly congresses. Cemeteries overgrown — sinking in nettles, plaques torn off Polish graves. There are no Greek-Catholic churches; there are only Orthodox churches, and only old women go to them. Working people and youth are not allowed to go to church. The Catholic church in Brody has been turned into a physical education school. The lyceum church in Krzemieniec is boarded up. The Catholic parish church is open once a month. The monastery in Podkamień has been turned into a home for the insane. In Podkamień on the roads lie smashed beautiful statues of saints. The buses dirty, rickety. The eateries disgusting. In the shops you can get anything of value only for a bribe. I didn’t believe Tulu when he told of grain drying on the highways, until I saw it with my own eyes. Everyone drinks vodka. Divorces are an everyday matter. I know that the present government on those lands doesn’t care, but if the Ukrainians were more cultured it wouldn’t be like that. I don’t want to go there anymore. Tulu is drawn there, but let him go alone.
