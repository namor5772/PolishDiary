Maybe it’s a funny title: “Me and the war,” but as I set about writing down these memories, I wanted to present my personal feelings and the fortunes of my immediate family during the war and after it ended. The composition of my immediate family: I was 32 in ’39. Tulu (my husband) 36. My husband’s mother (Babcia) 70, eldest daughter Lila 6, son Otuś 2, Ania was born on 11 October 1939. There was also a girl—domestic help—Hela. We lived then in Krzemieniec on Objazdowa Street. Tulu was a teacher at the Liceum im. T. Czackiego in Krzemieniec and head of the natural history department at the “Muzeum Ziemi Krzemienieckiej.” I was not teaching then.
In May 1939 the children came down with scarlet fever—strictly speaking it seems to have nothing to do with the war, and yet it does. The children were gravely ill, especially Otuś, and then I resolved that if the children recovered, I would give to the church the most precious thing I had—our wedding rings. The war broke out—the government issued an appeal to replenish the national treasury, so we donated those rings. More than once we talked about how surely someone had taken them and fled (thousands of people were fleeing) abroad, but deep down I did not regret and do not regret that step. My children and Poland are one. I remember how we didn’t leave the speaker when the Germans occupied Czechoslovakia, when the announcer bid farewell to the listeners, when the Czechoslovak anthem was played for the last time. I cried then and began to realize the horror drawing near to us too, to Poland.
On 1 September 1939 mobilization was announced. I will not list exact dates here, only the facts, the experiences that fixed themselves in my memory like images on a durable and precise plate. In the first days of September (or maybe at the end of August) Tadzik’s mother (now my son-in-law) stopped by on her way from Teremne for some treatment and asked our advice on what to do, whether to go on or return home. I advised her to return home and so she did.
Tulu got a double payment for two months, with which I bought some food such as flour, sugar, fat, cocoa (I used that cocoa for a long time to vary my Anusia’s meals). I put these supplies in Babcia’s ironbound trunk, added to that a fairly substantial amount of preserves and juices I had made in the summer, and we waited for the war—the war in Krzemieniec, the war in our house. Events unfolded like an avalanche. People passed through our house and yard like in a kaleidoscope.
The yard was full of cars. Refugees from western and central Poland were fleeing en masse through Krzemieniec and Zaleszczyki to Romania. At night the road leading through the Dubieńska Rogatka (a suburb of Krzemieniec) looked like a shining snake—lights of vehicles, an unbroken stream. The hum of the vehicles reached the apartment. On a certain fine day (probably around 11 September 1939) no one expected a bombing. The refugees had dispersed to buy food and there was plenty of it at the market then (the peasants had already heard about the approaching Soviet troops and supposed that their farms would be collectivized, and so they were selling off their possessions). With the wave of refugees a girl of about 12 reached Krzemieniec. She was entirely without family—we took her in—her name was Janka. On that beautiful morning, after consulting with Babcia, we sent Janka to the market for plums for knedle. Tulu went to register or hand in the radio at the police station. And then the bombing began. German planes dropped low right over the market, packed with people, and machine-gunned the populace directly. At the same time they bombed the entire main street; even the cemetery suffered seriously. Many people died then. The girl—Janka—jumped into the nearest doorway, where out of fear she sat almost until evening. Tulu, in the abandoned police building, lay down under a window and came back safe and sound. I was pregnant with Ania (Ania was born on 11 October ’39), I snatched two-year-old Otuś in my arms, took Lila by the hand, and calling Babcia, I ran and took shelter in the so-called “Skałki Dziewicze.” There were many people there from nearby houses. Babcia began to fluster around, ran into the flat and stayed at home. When we were then all together back home—I with the children and Tulu—we began to worry about Janka. Tulu went to the market and somehow found her and brought her home. From that day on there was alarm after alarm. We took shelter in the cellar, but in the end we stopped reacting to the sirens and sat at home as usual; only little Lila sat in the cellar all day long and, green with fear, dragged us all down there. At last the alarms ceased, and among the people the word spread that Soviet troops were approaching. The end of Poland and, as the Ukrainians said, “Polska łopnęta.” A new partition of Poland ensued—they divided her, the Russians and the Germans. I cried terribly, but I kept moving about the house, cleaning, scrubbing, and crying. One of the refugees, Marek—a miner—began to console me that he was in a worse situation because he was cut off from his family and the Germans were already there, that “the world won’t leave us like this.” We had already learned that England had declared war too. Since 1 September 1939 we had been waiting for the end of the war. The end of the war from day to day. From the first days of September prophecies began to circulate, suppositions that in a month, in 60 days, in 3 months it would end, that somewhere the Polish nation and army were resisting the Germans, etc., etc. I forgot to write that during the last prewar holidays Kazik Unold was staying with us—Hela, my sister—Kazik’s mother—was at a teachers’ course in Zaolzie. She dropped by at the beginning of September, took Kazik and, in accordance with orders of the Polish government, went to Podlis near Kowle to teach. It was a terrible Ukrainian village. Some of its inhabitants were already in September robbing and murdering refugees and Polish soldiers. By happy chance nothing happened to Hela—a trial was held over her composed of the entire village—there was nothing against her, and the trial was presided over by a political officer (politruk) of the Soviet army, who was of Polish origin. Hela even became headmistress of a ten-year school. I had heard a lot about the Bolshevik army and wanted to see it. The Ukrainians put up triumphal arches for them, welcomed them with bread and salt. They marched down the wide (main street of Krzemieniec). The soldiers, short, thin, undernourished, walked in helmets that covered half their faces. Our Ukrainian neighbor women, instead of looking at them, looked at me, and I was choked with tears.
Life in Krzemieniec slowly began to normalize. Some Polish refugees returned to their places in the Gubernatorstwo, some—especially men—fled abroad, mostly to Romania; some were deported to Siberia, and the remnants of the Polish Army fell into Russian captivity. Some were murdered outright by Ukrainians.
One of those who tried to get across the border was Witold Duda—Lotek. He visited us in Krzemieniec around 15 October ’39, said goodbye (under “Poland” he had been postmaster in Stalowa Wola and a reserve lieutenant) and set off toward Zdeszczyk. At the border he was caught by the Soviets and deported to a penal camp in the Komi Republic. Since I am already writing about him, I will finish his story. Only after a year did he write you a laconic postcard from the camp that he was well. That was all the news of him during the war. Only after the war did we reconnect with him and learn how he survived. After receiving the postcard we prepared a parcel (rusks made with eggs and milk, garlic, linden blossom, and some bacon) and with great difficulty sent it—I traveled with it as far as Smygi near Krzemieniec—the Bolsheviks made sending parcels difficult (the weight of the shipment could not exceed 2 kg). They kept designating different points and at different times. That parcel supposedly saved his life because he was already dying of hunger. When the understanding between Stalin and Sikorski was reached—Lotek joined the Anders Army. Along the way he married Danka Musiałówna, who had also been deported to Siberia. Lotek fought in Italy near Ancona. He left the army after the war with the rank of captain. He was in England and then left for Argentina, to Barilosze. He has a son, Andrzej, who is already married, and an adopted daughter. Now he would gladly return to Poland.
But back to us. My delivery was approaching. The yard had emptied of refugees. The girl we took in went back to her parents. On 9 October snow fell unexpectedly. Afraid that the vegetables would freeze in the garden, I dug them out from under the snow and, wet and heavy, carried them to the cellar, and that may have hastened the birth. Around midnight I sent Tulu for the midwife. Babcia was not feeling well, so I stoked the stove myself, put water on, prepared the [becik] and little shirts. Before the midwife had washed her hands—Anusia came into the world. A brave, clever girl. Brave even to the point of risk. She has already been on two “women’s voyages” (there were four women), and now, as I write this, she is sailing with only Kryśia on a small club yacht across the Baltic to the Gulf of Finland. I always worried about her and now enormously, because in the previous voyage they almost paid with their lives. At first Babcia was saddened that it was not a boy, but after a few days she liked Anusia very much. I lay in bed only 3 days, and even then only in snatches, because I had to bathe and diaper the child myself—the midwife did not come and Babcia was afraid.
After Anusia was born the weather turned beautiful. That was when Tulu’s brother, Lotek, burst in on us. Tulu taught in two Ukrainian schools. Polish schools had been abolished. I was a “chadziajka domowa.” Keeping—in fact feeding—the family was no small feat. There were queues for everything, and they were enormous, because many Jews had fled from the Gubernatorstwo to Krzemieniec. At times I would line up at midnight in order to bring home 25 dkg of sugar, or at most half a kilo, and often I came back empty-handed. Sometimes I managed to get some candies (very poor quality) and then there were feasts, because even the grown-ups could have tea “na prekusku.” Sugar was only for the children. Queues for bread. I usually brought home wholemeal bread—we like wholemeal, but the children, and especially little Ania, didn’t. Queues for flour, queues for salt. Polish textiles disappeared like camphor; some people bought them up already in September and the Bolshevik authorities confiscated the rest and exported them. From time to time shipments came in from Russia, but those were unbelievably poor materials. Mainly printed, shabby percales. I once bought (I stood in an enormous line) a few meters—the children, Babcia sewed into pajamas, and I sewed myself a dress. The prints on the pajamas peeled off in the first wash, and my dress looked like a rag after the first queue. In that queue they also tore my dress. I borrowed one safety pin and came home like that. There was no laundry soap. I made lye from ash and lightly soaped the dirtier parts of the linens with toilet soap, because that could be bought from time to time. We would turn the bed sheets to use both sides. Tulu mostly had light, typical shirts with sleeves and washing them was torture—the traditional way, in a washtub and with a washboard.
For milk the peasants did not want to take money, so I gave away coats, shoes, curtains from the house, because there had to be milk for the children. Fuel disappeared, and from almost the beginning of the war until we fled Krzemieniec we burned whatever I dragged from the forest or stole from nearby fences. In the forest I looked for the longest branches possible, tied the thicker end, slung it over my shoulder, and dragged it home. My left shoulder was swollen and sore. There was peat in the vicinity of Krzemieniec, but they sold it only to Ukrainians or to those who worked with it. So I too went to Sapanów. I worked literally on bread and water. I slept on hay at a peasant’s, and by then it was already dangerous because the peasants were preparing to murder Poles. I stacked peat into small piles over a measured area. In the evening I could not straighten my back, and the tips of my fingers bled. Despite everything I persevered for a dozen or so days and brought home large cartloads of peat. That was a treasure, because winter was approaching and I no longer had the strength to go to the forest. I brought that peat just before the war between the USSR and Germany, and under the German occupation a Pole simply had no right to go into the forest, because death threatened from both the Germans and the Ukrainians. It was fortunate that Babcia was at home to look after the children, because I was constantly “on the go”: to the queues, to barter clothes for food, to the forest for wood.
Until the war with Germany we were terribly afraid of deportation to Siberia. At first they deported the families of soldiers, policemen, forestry service, higher officials, families of suspects—and we belonged among them, because Tulu’s brother, Witold, was in a penal camp in Siberia. All Poles were “suspect,” even refugees from the Gubernatorstwo. For fear of deportation I always kept bread rusks and dry pasta on hand, and I nursed Ania until a year and a half. Since Tulu was working, arranging the christening was hard, and besides we were waiting for the end of the war, and then the christening would be solemn within the family circle. Meanwhile the end of the war did not come and Ania was growing, so as a one-and-a-half-year-old girl she went on foot with Babcia and me to church. Our acquaintance Mr Werner and Balcia “held” her for baptism. I am writing “held” in quotation marks because I remember that Ania, in a long cream dress altered from my prewar ball gown, was standing by herself on a chest in the sacristy. Ania was already running and talking well then. Despite the hard times Ania thrived. She began to walk in the ninth month. Babcia was very happy to be godmother; after the other grandmother (my mother) she received the name I like very much—Joanna. As I already mentioned, I was constantly busy, preoccupied; Babcia, on the other hand, told the children lovely fairy tales of her own invention, read to them, fed them. I also read to them a bit, especially Porazińska’s verses. I remember that I made up melodies to almost all the little poems and read them “singing,” and later, when I taught, I also “sang” in the first grades. Lila had just before the war passed her first entrance exam to first grade of the practice school at the Liceum. Naturally she passed it well, especially as regards colors. In September 1939 Lila began first grade, but since “Polska Topła” the language of instruction was Ukrainian and Lila didn’t know it at all—and besides we expected the end of the war any day—so we took Lila out. I remember that classes were held on Sundays too and that put me off as well, and Lila stayed home. I taught her reading and writing here and there—she learned quickly; arithmetic was harder, but only now do I realize that Lila was a clever girl, because she learned the four operations up to 20 and then 100 without manipulatives or much explanation. Little Otuś listened to fairy tales and rode a lot with Dad on the bicycle. Otuś was born with black hair already—I too was a brunette—and when I walked with Otuś everyone took us for Jews. The children had only a few toys. Just before the war Otuś got a little monkey, and we fled Krzemieniec with that monkey; that monkey was still knocking about in Helena in Sącz. I regret not keeping it. Instead of toys the children had lots of little books, paints, paper, crayons. Early on Otuś began to draw tiny little figures—the pages teemed with [drawing of stick figure] and I sang to them.
