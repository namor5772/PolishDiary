Poles in the Gubernatorstwo were persecuted by the Germans in a terrible way, but for us in the so-called Ukraine it was probably even worse. In the Gubernatorstwo it was the Germans against the Poles, and here yet another terrible enemy joined in: the Ukrainians, and we were a minority. The Ukrainians matched the Germans step for step. It was they who handed us over to the Bolsheviks and later to the Germans. It was they who delivered truly very valuable people to death (prof. Opolski, Mączak, Sawojcówna, Torgoński, Szynajowiecz, and many, many others). This awaited us, and above all Tula, as well, but the eastern front began to approach and so we fled. Prof. Mączak was the founder of the Museum, Dr. Opolski wrote a treatise on Hitlerism just before the war. One hears nothing about Ukrainians imprisoned and perishing in concentration camps. Ania had some severe pains; she cried at times. No wonder, if at home there was, for example, only rye flour (Maybe that is why I don’t like rye bread so much). So I took Ania in my arms and went to the “Gebitskomisarza” for semolina for Ania. I waited perhaps two hours to be admitted before the dignitary. I explained my request to the Ukrainian interpreter, and they jabbered among themselves and didn’t give me even 25 dkg of semolina. The Ukrainians at first betrayed us and informed the Bolsheviks — never would so many of us have been deported to Siberia, taken to prisons, shot, if not for the Ukrainians. As soon as the war began the Ukrainians were in contact with the Germans via transmitting stations, they murdered refugees from western Poland, etc., etc.
The death of Julek Unold, his brothers, the death of thousands of Poles at the hands of the Ukrainians.
