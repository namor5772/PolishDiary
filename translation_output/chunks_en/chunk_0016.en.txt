We arrived one beautiful September day in Kąty. Sun, fruit on the trees. We set up our “camp” at an acquaintance’s farm—Wokurki, in a new house under the hill. Ciocia Nusia drove us there and turned back to Zmigrod to save and secure property. Meanwhile the front suddenly drew near and took Kąty into its range. Part of the inhabitants, along with their cattle, took shelter in the woods, part in vaulted cellars. We spread kilims on the floor and lay down on them “like a pancake”: the sick Julek, his six-year-old daughter Bogna, Tulu, me, Lila, Otuś and Ania. Our hosts fled to the forest. The house trembles from exploding shells, plaster falls from the walls and dusts us, the room is white with it. Out of the blue a first Soviet soldier walks into the house, opens a window, sets up a machine gun in it and fires. I beg him to leave this house because there are children and a gravely ill man here. It did no good. He advised us to leave the house, but how—Julek was on crutches, little children, and outside bullets were whistling thickly. Where to go?! The woods were too far, we didn’t know how far to any cellar. (The cellars were separate, almost completely dug into the ground, only their rounded roofs stuck up above it.) With a heavy heart we left Julek (at his urgent pleading), the children put on their little coats, we gathered only a suitcase with documents and literally between bullets we crept, ran, wanting to reach some cellar. We came upon perhaps two and no one took us in. Under the little roof of one cellar stood a peasant; magnanimously, he advised us to get under the root hollow of trees by the Wisłoka. Indeed, tall trees grow along the Wisłoka, we scurried down the steep bank and nestled into a cavity under the roots. Above us were the Bolsheviks; on the opposite bank of the Wisłoka, the Germans. Fighting! Bullets splashed right at our feet as they hit the water. At one point a figure of a German with a rifle ready to fire emerged from behind the corner of a house on the other side of the Wisłoka. I went numb because he was aiming in our direction. Perhaps he realized they were civilians with children—we stayed alive. We sat under that root cavity almost until dusk. In the meantime Tulu “visited” Julek twice. Although the house was left without windows, Julek survived. Toward evening we got into acquaintances’ cellar. It was tiny; along one wall stood chests with the owners’ clothes and bedding. We lined the free half with kilims. Two thirds of the little cellar was a single bed on which at times 13–14 people slept side by side. Apart from the small children, no one could straighten their legs. Poor, tall, sick Julek! The little cellar, especially at night, shook to its foundations; heavy tanks drove right past the door. If a grenade had hit the roof, we would all have been buried. In the morning it was quieter. Then we came out of the little cellar. Both of us, with Nusia, combed and washed the children. We cooked in the cottage, on the sly and in a hurry we peeled potatoes and even ground grain on the quern-stones. We had fat in the form of rendered butter. Just before the offensive I bought a little piglet; naturally it stayed in Zmigrod, but our acquaintance Jan Nowak (he is now a judge) killed it and brought us half to Kąty. We cooked “ein Topf,” and only Julek ate separately; the rest of us from one pot. Kąty went back into German hands. The village was strewn with soldiers’ corpses. Tulu had to bury them. In the neighboring house there was a so-called “Szreibsztuba.” The Germans drove any civilians they caught to build a bridge that Soviet planes bombed. Tulu was driven there several times. The Germans were catching chickens all over Kąty and made Nusia and me pluck them. One time I started griping, calling the Germans Szwabs [Swabians] and so on. One of them, who was dozing with his back propped against the kitchen table, understood Polish, sprang at me with a revolver—I bolted for the cellar—the German after me, only Tulu blocked his way and began to excuse me—it worked, because the German waved his hand and walked off. Among the Germans milling about there were also cultured ones, even with a heart. Am I not overdoing it with that “heart”? But fact is fact—one of those Germans almost every day took Ania in his arms, carried her to the supply truck and loaded her up with either sugar or some canned goods. The front dragged on; for us it was ages. We decided to get out of Kąty. But how? It was far to the point from which one could leave the front by military vehicle, especially for sick, limping Julek, and on top of that there were small children and some belongings. Nusia found out that the German on whom our fate depended was celebrating his name day or birthday. She gathered some autumn flowers from neighboring gardens and went to offer congratulations. She came back with a promise that they would take us out of Kąty; only we had to reach the point on our own. On foot was impossible because Julek was lame, small children, belongings. Some means of transport depended on the commander of the “Szreibsztube.” I was the one who had to procure that wagon. I went to the German and he started making advances—luckily a frontline soldier came to report in and that saved me. We got the wagon. We loaded it with our belongings, seated the sick Julek and little Anusia on it, Lila, Otuś and Bogna clung to the back of the wagon and rode standing up. We hadn’t gone far when the Soviets began to rake the road with a hurricane of fire. It was hell. We grabbed Ania, helped Julek down in a flash and took shelter in the nearest cellar. Meanwhile our carter drove the horses with our belongings to the vehicle departure point. Again, a horrible problem—how to get there with sick Julek and small children. Not far away there was an improvised dressing station. We went there with Nusia. The chief doctor, furious, was living essentially on black coffee and cigarettes because he was continuously performing amputations on wounded Germans. Somehow we implored someone from the auxiliary personnel and they gave us an ambulance in which Julek arrived. The children and we went on foot. Our things were piled in an empty barn—again, an attack. Lila and Otuś were in the barn then and its tiles were showering down onto the yard. Naturally we came out of that unscathed too, but to finish us off, a heavy rain began to pour; mud up to the ankles, and through that mud we carried our belongings to the truck waiting for us. As the children scrambled under the truck’s tarp, a puddle literally formed around each of them. Not one of the children, nor even we, so much as sneezed. At last we drove beyond the front line—it felt almost foolish in that silence. They delivered us late at night to some locality and we found ourselves in an empty room with straw and hay on the floor. The Germans who were sitting in the rooms beyond gave us hot black coffee and we lay down to sleep side by side. In the morning we set out further. The driver was a bit tipsy and wanted to take us right to the house in Turza near Gorlice. In that house lived Julek’s brother, a teacher in Turza. Right before our destination this ride could have ended tragically. The road was slippery, clayey, climbing uphill, with steep drops on the left and right, the so-called “paryje” [ravines]. The truck was right above the precipice when Ania let out a terrible scream and the hapless driver cut the engine. We got out carefully so the truck wouldn’t tip over, and partly on foot, partly on a wagon brought by Kazik Kędzior, we reached our destination. Nusia, with Julek and Bogna, moved into a tiny room at Kazik’s, and we stayed nearby with a widow.
