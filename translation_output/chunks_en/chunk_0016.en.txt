I started copying out that application and gave up. Nuts! They let me go, period. Just one more thing on the subject. When I was defending myself like a lion against going into retirement, one of the teachers told me: "It's hard—age comes and you have to leave. For railwaymen, as soon as they hit 60 they absolutely have to go." I was indignant at such a comparison and said that if a writer hits 60 then he mustn’t write, a poet create, a painter paint.
I at least fought for as much as that, that despite the relatively too short period—only 21 years of work—I was receiving a pension not much smaller than Tulu’s. Tulu has 2420 zł—I've got 2379 zł. Maybe now I’ll still manage to devote time not so much to the children as at least to the grandchildren! The children and I! Lila was 6, Otuś only 2 when the war started. Ania was born at the beginning of the war, Iwonka a short time after the war, and all my effort was directed above all not so much at bringing them up as at keeping the children alive. When the situation finally began to improve, essentially the children had already grown up and started leaving home one after another. I had no time to raise them in any organized, deliberate way; besides, the children seemed such a part of me, simply my whole self, that I often caught myself feeling as if they had been with me since my earliest years, that they feel and think just as I do. My father inscribed for me in such a book—a diary m.p. [abbr. unclear] "He who rises early, the Lord God gives him good," "With truthfulness you will get through the world," "Love of the Homeland and honor are the most important good," and so on. I read Rodziewiczówna, Kraszewski, Sienkiewicz, Mickiewicz, Słowacki, Konopnicka. The ideals of those writers became my ideals. I was foolish and I am foolish, though so-called honest. I wrote many things that take place already after the war, but those are, well, the consequences of the war.
I would still like to write a lot about the children, about their youthful years, about their studies and life as adults. The one thing that cannot be changed is that their worries, their life, arouse in me a constant anxiety; they often rob me of sleep. Although many things make me happy, although I would like at least to embroider some pretty things, because really that’s about all I can do (I can’t play, I can’t paint), in the end I would rather die already so as to stop forever fearing and worrying about the children.
